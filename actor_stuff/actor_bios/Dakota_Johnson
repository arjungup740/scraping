Thompson, whom her father was longtime friends with, who would often come to their house in the early morning hours, announcing his presence by discharging a firearm.[7] She attended the Aspen Community School for a time.[8] "I was so consistently unmoored and discombobulated, I didn't have an anchor anywhere," Johnson recalled.[9]  She attended the Santa Catalina School in Monterey, California, for her freshman year of high school before transferring to the private New Roads School in Santa Monica, California.[10] Johnson became interested in modeling at age twelve after taking part in a photoshoot with other celebrities' children for Teen Vogue,[11] and subsequently earned an income modeling while attending high school in Santa Monica.[4] She has struggled with depression since around age fourteen[12] and checked into rehabilitation.[13] Johnson was interested in acting as a child, spending significant time on film sets with her parents, but they dissuaded her from pursuing the profession until she graduated from high school.[14] After high school, she was turned down by Juilliard in New York City; her audition featured a cover of a Radiohead song.[4] In 1999, Johnson made her film debut in Crazy in Alabama where she and her sister Stella Banderas played daughters to their real-life mother, Melanie Griffith.

In response to questions regarding her stance on gender rights concerning her character in the Fifty Shades film series, Johnson stated: "I'm proud of [the film]. I completely disagree with people who think Ana's weak. I think she's actually stronger than he is. Everything she does is her choice. And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want to do with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want, then I'm all for that."[28] On February 15, 2015, Johnson appeared on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary special and hosted SNL on February 28, 2015, making her the second daughter of a former SNL host (after Gwyneth Paltrow, whose mother Blythe Danner hosted during the show's seventh season in 1982) to host the show. Also in 2015, she reunited with her 21 Jump Street cast member Johnny Depp, playing the mother of his character's child in the feature film Black Mass.[29] Jessica Kiang of IndieWire said that she "makes something of nothing" in her role.[30] In 2015, Johnson starred in Luca Guadagnino's thriller A Bigger Splash,[31] alongside Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts and Ralph Fiennes.[32] She performed in one cover of the song "Unforgettable", alongside Fiennes for the movie's soundtrack.[citation needed] Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers stated that Johnson showed that her character "has more on her mind than slithering seductively".[33] According to Christy Lemire from RogerEbert.com: "A Bigger Splash allows Johnson to be both funnier and sexier than she was in Fifty Shades of Grey".[34] The same year saw the release of Cymbeline, a modern film adaptation of the William Shakespeare play, in which she starred opposite Ethan Hawke and Ed Harris.[35] She also played a lead in the 2016 comedy How to Be Single, with Leslie Mann and her Date and Switch co-star Nicholas Braun.[36] She performed a cover of the song "Can't Take My Eyes Off of You", alongside actors Zani Jones Mbayise, Vanessa Rubio and Damon Wayans Jr. for the soundtrack of the film.[citation needed] Johnson was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in June 2016.[37] Johnson trained in dance to prepare for Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria (2018), a supernatural horror film and remake of the 1977 film by Dario Argento, in which she plays an American dancer in Berlin who enrolls in an academy run by a coven of witches.[6] David Ehrlich of IndieWire described Johnson's performance in the film as "thrillingly unrepentant".[38] Also in 2018, she starred in Drew Goddard's neo-noir thriller Bad Times at the El Royale, with Jeff Bridges, Jon Hamm and Chris Hemsworth. In the film, she plays a hippie staying at a resort on the California-Nevada border where the lives of various people with suspicious pasts intersect.[39] Screen Rant ranked Johnson's performance as the fourth-best in the film and stated that "she brings a reserved, under-the-surface power to her role".[40] In 2019, Johnson starred in the psychological horror film, Wounds, opposite Armie Hammer, directed by Babak Anvari, based upon a horror novella The Visible Filth by Nathan Ballingrud.[41] It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2019.[42] She then starred in the well-reviewed independent adventure film, The Peanut Butter Falcon, opposite Shia LaBeouf and Bruce Dern,[43] which had its world premiere at South by Southwest on March 9, 2019.[44] She appeared in the drama film Our Friend, opposite Casey Affleck and Jason Segel, and directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite.

She is the least assertive of movie stars, yet the courage, despair and fury she finds in Nicole will lift you up and spin you around".[46] While Gary Goldstein from the Los Angeles Times stated that Johnson "impresses with affecting range — from flirty, ebullient and adoring to stalwart, enraged and resigned; it's a lovely performance".[47] Johnson founded the production company TeaTime Pictures, alongside former Netflix development executive Ro Donnelly, to develop film and television projects.[48] In 2020, Johnson made her directorial debut, co-directing (with Cory Bailey) the music video for Coldplay's "Cry Cry Cry", which featured her boyfriend Chris Martin.[49] Johnson starred alongside Tracee Ellis Ross in the dramedy film The High Note, which was released on May 29, 2020.[50] Her performance was seen as "maybe her best and certainly most lovable performance" according to the Chicago Sun Times.[51] Scott Mendelson of Forbes stated that Johnson and Kelvin Harrison Jr. had "a relaxed, natural chemistry, and their slow-burn scenes form the film's emotional backbone",[52] conversely Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that "she's lovely to look at and can never be accused of overacting, but in terms of conveying single-minded drive, Johnson is no match for [Tracee Ellis] Ross's carefully calibrated tonal swings between imperiousness, self-awareness, isolation and down-to-earth intimacy."[53] In 2021, She co-starred in The Lost Daughter directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, based on the novel of the same name by Elena Ferrante.[54] She is set to star in Am I Ok? by Stephanie Allyne and Tig Notaro,[55] a Netflix-adaptation of author Jane Austen's Persuasion,[56] Cha Cha Real Smooth by Cooper Raiff,[57] Daddio directed by Christy Hall[58] and in Crackpot for director Elaine May.[59] Additionally, Johnson signed on to star and produce Rodeo Queens, a mockumentary series directed by Carrie Brownstein for Amazon Studios.[60] Johnson will serve as an executive producer on several films under TeaTime Pictures.
