Rapace was born in Hudiksvall, Sweden. Her mother, Nina Norén (born Kristina Norén; 1954), is a Swedish actress, and her father, Rogelio Durán (10 November 1953 – 4 November 2006), was a Spanish Flamenco singer from Badajoz.[3] She has said her father may have been of part Romani descent, and though she is "not sure if it is true," she has "always been interested in the culture."[4][5] Rapace's sister, Særún Norén, is a photographer.[6] Rapace has said she saw her father only occasionally before his death. At age five, she moved from her native Sweden to Flúðir in Iceland with her mother and stepfather. Two years later, she made her film debut in a minor role in the Icelandic film In the Shadow of the Raven.[7] Rapace speaks fluent Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian and English, in addition to her native Swedish.[7] At the age of seven, Rapace was given her first film role, a non-speaking part in the Icelandic film In the Shadow of the Raven by Hrafn Gunnlaugsson. This experience prompted her to be an actress.[8] She left home at age 15 and enrolled in a Stockholm theatre school.[9] In 1996, Rapace made her television debut playing the part of Lucinda Gonzales in the long-running soap series Tre kronor.

She won the two top film awards in Denmark (the Bodil and Robert prize) for Best Actress for her role in the film, which was also selected for the main competition at the San Sebastián International Film Festival. The film received some criticism for the supposed abuse occurring to a baby actor during production.[13] In 2009, she played the role of Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish-produced film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's best-selling novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, for which she won the Guldbagge Award (Sweden's top film award),[14] and was nominated for a BAFTA Award[15] and European Film Award.[16] She later appeared in the same role in the sequels The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. All three films were subsequently recut as a six-part miniseries aired on Swedish television called Millennium, for which Rapace received a nomination for the International Emmy Award for Best Actress.[17] The three film adaptations have earned over $200 million at the box office worldwide.[18] Following the success of the Millennium series, Rapace started an international career.[19] Her first English-speaking role was the character of Madame Simza Heron in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, released in 2011.[20] Her international fame has earned her leading roles in mainstream cinema. She was cast in Ridley Scott's blockbuster hit Prometheus, where she played the leading role, a scientist named Elizabeth Shaw. She had met Scott for the first time following the release of the Millennium trilogy movies, at which point he expressed a willingness to work with her and encouraged her to improve her accent.[21] Prometheus was released in June 2012.[22] She did not appear in the final cut of the film's sequel Alien: Covenant (2017), but did act in a short related prologue.[23] In November 2012, she appeared in a Rolling Stones video for the single "Doom and Gloom", shot in the studios of the Cité du Cinéma by Luc Besson in Saint-Denis.[24] In 2013, she starred alongside Rachel McAdams in Brian De Palma's erotic thriller Passion, which is the English-language remake of 2010's French psychological thriller Love Crime.
