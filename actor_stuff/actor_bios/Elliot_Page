In June 2012, Quantic Dream announced the video game Beyond: Two Souls in which Page portrays one of the protagonists, Jodie Holmes; it was released on October 8, 2013, in North America.[52][53][54] The game polarized critics,[55] but Page earned praise for his performance, with GamesTM calling it "truly breathtaking [...] one of the truly great videogame acting showcases".[56] He was given various awards and nominations for the role, including the British Academy Games Award for Best Performer.[57] In 2013, Page stated that his directorial debut would be Miss Stevens, and would star Anna Faris and be produced by Gary Gilbert, Jordan Horowitz and Doug Wald;[58][59] the project eventually moved forward without Page, with scriptwriter Julia Hart replacing Page as the director.[60] Also in 2013, he co-starred in Zal Batmanglij's thriller The East, a film inspired by the experiences and drawing on thrillers from the 1970s,[61] and he also starred in Lynn Shelton's Touchy Feely.

But the choppy, cliched visuals and the script's superficial approach to the characters' predicaments ultimately undo any goodwill that the actors can generate."[90] Also in 2017, he produced and starred in the film The Cured.[91] In 2019, Page starred in the Netflix miniseries Tales of the City as Shawna Hopkins,[92][93] which received positive reviews.[94][95] Page, along with Ian Daniel, directed and produced the documentary There's Something in the Water, which is about environmental racism;[96] the film premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival,[97] and was later released on Netflix on March 27, 2020.[98] The film received positive reviews from critics, with The Hollywood Reporter writing that the film, while "made in a standard documentary format that includes a voiceover and a tad too much weepy music", "gets its job done directly enough, underlining a situation that remains dire despite what seems to be a growing level awareness around the country".[99] Page will next have a voice role in the upcoming film Naya Legend of the Golden Dolphin and Robodog.[100] In August 2021, Page collaborated with Mark Rendall for a music release on Bandcamp.[101] The three track EP has been described as "lo-fi bedroom pop adventure" in the press.[102] In August 2021, he signed an overall deal with Universal Content Productions.[103] In February 2022, it was announced that Flatiron Books had acquired the publishing rights to Pageboy, a memoir written by Page, for $3 million, with the book set to release in 2023.[104] On abortion rights, in 2008, Page described himself as a pro-choice feminist.[105] He was one of 30 celebrities who participated in a 2008 online advertisement series for US Campaign for Burma, calling for an end to the military dictatorship in Myanmar.[106] Page practices a vegan lifestyle, and PETA named him and Jared Leto the Sexiest Vegetarians of 2014.[107] He is an atheist, having remarked that religion "has always been used for beautiful things, and also as a way to justify discrimination".[108] On February 14, 2014, Page, who was then presenting as female, came out as gay[8] during a speech at the Human Rights Campaign's "Time to Thrive" conference in Las Vegas.[109][110][111] In November 2017, Page stated that he had been outed at age 18 by filmmaker Brett Ratner while on the set of X-Men: The Last Stand.[112] His account was corroborated by co-star Anna Paquin, who said that she was present when Ratner made the comment.

We love you Elliot!"[123] Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several celebrities, such as Ellen DeGeneres, James Gunn, and Kumail Nanjiani, expressed support for Page after the announcement.[124][125] That same day, subscription streaming service and production company Netflix announced that it would immediately adjust the credits in its streaming library from Ellen to Elliot.[126] These changes were completed by December 8 on the films Tallulah (2016) and Flatliners (2017), the television series The Umbrella Academy (first two seasons, 2019–2020), and the television miniseries Tales of the City (2019).[127] Page appeared on the cover of the March 29 / April 5, 2021 issue of Time, making him the first openly trans man to do so.[7] He requested that Wynne Neilly photograph him for the cover because he wanted another transgender person to be the photographer.[128] In the featured article, he described himself as queer and nonbinary,[7][129] and revealed that at the time he came out, he had been recovering from undergoing top surgery,[130] a process that he described as "not only life-changing but lifesaving".
