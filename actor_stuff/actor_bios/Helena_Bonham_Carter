Bonham Carter rose to prominence by playing Lucy Honeychurch in A Room with a View (1985) and the title character in Lady Jane (1986). Her early period roles saw her typecast as a virginal "English rose", a label she was uncomfortable with.[1] She is best known for her eccentric fashion, dark aesthetic, and for often playing quirky women.[2][3][4] For her role as Kate Croy in The Wings of the Dove (1997), Bonham Carter received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in The King's Speech (2010), she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

From 2019 to 2020, she portrayed Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon in seasons three and four of Netflix's The Crown. Bonham Carter was born in Islington, London.[5] Her father, Raymond Bonham Carter, who came from a prominent British political family, was a merchant banker and served as the alternative British director representing the Bank of England at the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., during the 1960s.[6][7][8] Her mother, Elena (née Propper de Callejón), is a psychotherapist who is of Spanish and mostly Jewish background, and whose parents were diplomat Eduardo Propper de Callejón from Spain and painter Baroness Hélène Fould-Springer.[6][9] Bonham Carter's paternal grandmother was politician and feminist Violet Bonham Carter, daughter of H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the first half of the First World War.[10] Bonham Carter has two older brothers, Edward and Thomas. They were brought up in Golders Green and she was educated at South Hampstead High School, and completed her A-levels at Westminster School. Bonham Carter has said that she was denied admission to King's College, Cambridge because the college officials were afraid that she would leave during the course to pursue her acting career.[11] When Bonham Carter was five, her mother had a serious nervous breakdown, from which it took her three years to recover. Soon afterwards, her mother's experience in therapy led her to become a psychotherapist herself. Bonham Carter has since paid her to read her scripts and deliver opinions on the characters' psychological motivations.[12] Five years after her mother's recovery, her father was diagnosed with acoustic neuroma. He suffered complications during an operation to remove the tumour which led to a stroke leaving him half-paralysed and using a wheelchair.[13] With her brothers at college, Bonham Carter was left to help her mother cope. She later studied her father's movements and mannerisms for her role in The Theory of Flight.[14] He died in January 2004.[15] Bonham Carter, who has no formal acting training,[16] entered the field winning a national writing contest (1979) and used the money to pay for her entry into the actors' Spotlight directory. She made her professional acting debut at the age of 16 in a television commercial. She also had a minor part in the 1983 TV film A Pattern of Roses.[17] Bonham Carter's first lead film role was as Lady Jane Grey in Lady Jane (1986), which was given mixed reviews by critics. Her breakthrough role was Lucy Honeychurch in A Room with a View (1985), which was filmed after Lady Jane but released two months earlier. She also appeared in episodes of Miami Vice as Don Johnson's love interest during the 1986–87 season and then, in 1987 with Dirk Bogarde in The Vision, Stewart Granger in A Hazard of Hearts and John Gielgud in Getting It Right. Bonham Carter was originally cast in the role of Bess McNeill in Breaking the Waves, but backed out during production owing to "the character's painful psychic and physical exposure", according to Roger Ebert.[18] The role went to Emily Watson, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance.[19] Her early films led to her being typecast as a "corset queen" and "English rose", playing pre- and early 20th century characters, particularly in Merchant Ivory films.[1] Uncomfortable with this image, she states: "I looked, as someone said, like a bloated chipmunk".[1] In 1994, Bonham Carter appeared in a dream sequence during the second series of the British sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, as Edina Monsoon's daughter Saffron, who was normally played by Julia Sawalha. Throughout the series, references were made to Saffron's resemblance to Bonham Carter.[20] Bonham Carter speaks French fluently and starred in a 1996 French film titled Portraits chinois. That same year, she played Olivia in Trevor Nunn's film version of Twelfth Night. One of the high points of her early career was her performance as the scheming Kate Croy in the 1997 film adaption of The Wings of the Dove which was highly acclaimed internationally and netted her first Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations. Then followed Fight Club in 1999 where she played Marla Singer, a role which saw her win the 2000 Empire Award for Best British Actress.[21] In August 2001, she was featured in Maxim. She played her second Queen of England when she was cast as Anne Boleyn in the ITV1 mini-series Henry VIII; however, her role was restricted, as she was pregnant with her first child at the time of filming.[22] She was a member of the 2006 Cannes Film Festival jury that unanimously selected The Wind That Shakes the Barley as best film.[23] In May 2006, Bonham Carter launched her own fashion line, "The Pantaloonies", with swimwear designer Samantha Sage. Their first collection, called Bloomin' Bloomers, is a Victorian style selection of camisoles, mob caps, and bloomers. The duo worked on Pantaloonies customised jeans, which Bonham Carter describes as "a kind of scrapbook on the bum".[24] Bonham Carter played Bellatrix Lestrange in the final four Harry Potter films (2007–2011). While filming Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, she accidentally perforated the eardrum of Matthew Lewis (playing Neville Longbottom) when she stuck her wand into his ear canal.[25] Bonham Carter received positive reviews as Bellatrix, described as a "shining but underused talent".[26][25] She played Mrs. Lovett, Sweeney Todd's (Johnny Depp) amorous accomplice, in the film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's Broadway musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, directed by Burton.[27] 
Bonham Carter received a nomination for the Golden Globe for Best Actress for her performance. She won the Best Actress award in the 2007 Evening Standard British Film Awards for her performances in Sweeney Todd and Conversations With Other Women, along with another Best Actress award at the 2009 Empire Awards. Bonham Carter also appeared in the fourth Terminator film, entitled Terminator Salvation, playing a small but pivotal role as a personification of Skynet.[28] Bonham Carter joined the cast of Tim Burton's 2010 film, Alice in Wonderland, as the Red Queen.[29]

In 2020, Bonham Carter starred as Eudoria Holmes in the Netflix film Enola Holmes, which is based on The Enola Holmes Mysteries.[54] In August 2008, four of Bonham Carter's relatives were killed in a safari bus crash in South Africa,[55] and she was given indefinite leave from filming Terminator Salvation, returning later to complete filming.[56] In early October 2008, it was reported that Bonham Carter had become a patron of the charity Action Duchenne, the national charity established to support parents and sufferers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.[57] In August 2014, Bonham Carter was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.[58] In 2016, Bonham Carter said she was keen on the UK remaining in the European Union in regard to the referendum on that issue.[59] In 1994, Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh met while filming Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. They began an affair while Branagh was still married to Emma Thompson, whom he had met in 1987 while filming the BBC Series Fortunes of War and married in 1989.[60] At the time, Thompson's career was soaring, while Branagh was struggling to make a success of his first big-budget film (Mary Shelley's Frankenstein).[60] Following his affair with Bonham Carter, Branagh and Thompson divorced in 1995.[61] In 1999, after five years together, Bonham Carter and Branagh separated.[62] Thompson has said she has "no hard feelings" towards Bonham Carter, calling her affair with Branagh "blood under the bridge".[63] She explained, "You can't hold on to anything like that. It's pointless. I haven't got the energy for it. Helena and I made our peace years and years ago. She's a wonderful woman."[63] Thompson, Branagh, and Bonham Carter all later went on to appear in the Harry Potter series, albeit in different films. In 2001, Bonham Carter began a relationship with American director Tim Burton, whom she met while filming Planet of the Apes. Burton cast her in his films, including Big Fish, Corpse Bride, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows. After their separation, Bonham Carter said, "It might be easier to work together without being together any more. He always only cast me with great embarrassment."[64] Bonham Carter and Burton lived in adjoining houses in Belsize Park, London. Bonham Carter owned one of the houses; Burton later bought the other and they connected the two. In 2006, they bought the Mill House in Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire.[65] It was previously leased by her grandmother, Violet Bonham Carter, and owned by her great-grandfather H. H. Asquith.[65][66] Bonham Carter and Burton have two children together: son Billy Raymond Burton (born 4 October 2003)[67] and daughter Nell Burton (born 15 December 2007).[68] Bonham Carter has stated that Nell is named after all the "Helens" in her family.[9][68] Bonham Carter told The Daily Telegraph of her struggles with infertility and the difficulties she had during her pregnancies. She said that before the conception of her daughter, she and Burton had been trying for a baby for two years and, although they conceived naturally, they were considering in vitro fertilisation.[69] On 23 December 2014, Bonham Carter and Burton announced that they had "separated amicably" earlier that year.[70][71] Of the separation, Bonham Carter told Harper's Bazaar: "Everyone always says you have to be strong and have a stiff upper lip, but it's okay to be fragile.... You've got to take very small steps, and sometimes you won't know where to go next because you've lost yourself". She added: "With divorce, you go through massive grief—it is a death of a relationship, so it's utterly bewildering. Your identity, everything, changes."[64] Bonham Carter is known for her unconventional and eccentric sense of fashion.[72][73] British Vogue described her dark style in clothing and acting as "quirky and irreverent".[74] Vanity Fair named her on its 2010 Best-Dressed List[75] and she was selected by Marc Jacobs to be the face of his Autumn/Winter 2011 advertising campaign.[76] She has cited Vivienne Westwood and Marie Antoinette as her main style influences.[75] In May 2021, Bonham Carter featured in a commercial for the British furniture retailer Sofology, taking viewers through the quirks and stylistic flourishes of her home.[77] Bonham Carter's paternal grandparents were British Liberal politicians Sir Maurice Bonham-Carter and Lady Violet Bonham Carter.
