Speaking at 200 words per minute and pausing for 1.2 seconds between sentences, Irons came very close to the ideal voice model, with the linguist  Andrew Linn explaining why his "deep gravelly tones" inspired trust in listeners.[42] As German villain Simon Gruber his recital of the English riddle "As I was going to St Ives" (from Die Hard with a Vengeance) appears in the 2014 book The Art of Communicating Eloquently.[43] In 2017 he recited the spoken sections, most notably "Late Lament", for The Moody Blues' 50th Anniversary Tour of "Days Of Future Passed", and also appears on the video presentation.[44] In 1985, Irons directed a music video for Carly Simon and her heavily promoted single, "Tired of Being Blonde", and in 1994, he had a cameo role in the video for Elastica's hit single "Connection".[45] Irons has contributed to other musical performances, recording William Walton's Façade with Dame Peggy Ashcroft, Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale conducted by the composer, and in 1987 the songs from Lerner and Loewe's My Fair Lady with Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, released on the Decca label.

He then named George W. Bush as the living person he most despised, stating “to hold his position he should have surrounded himself with more reliable people.”[55] In 2009, Irons signed a petition in support of Polish film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after he was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.[56] He has been criticised in the British Medical Journal for his fundraising activities in support of the College of Medicine, an alternative medicine lobby group in the UK linked to Prince Charles.[57] In 2013, he caused controversy for an interview with the HuffPost, in which he said he "doesn't have a strong feeling either way" on gay marriage but expressed fears that it could "debase" marital law, suggesting it could be manipulated to allow fathers to avoid paying tax when passing on their estates to their sons, because he supposed incest laws would not apply to men.[58][59] He later clarified his comments, saying he was providing an example of a situation that could cause a "legal quagmire" under the laws that allow same-gender marriage, and that he had been misinterpreted. He added that some gay relationships are "healthier" than their heterosexual counterparts.[60] He said in a BBC interview that he wished he had "buttoned" his lip before asking if its legalization would see fathers marry sons.[61][62] He supports the legal availability of abortion, having said that he believes that "women should be allowed to make the decision". Nevertheless, he agreed with a pro-life advocate and was quoted as saying that "the church is right to say it's a sin".[63] He is the Patron of the "Emergency Response Team Search and Rescue" or "ERTSAR" which is a life saving United Nations recognised disaster response search and rescue team and registered Charity. It is based in his home County of Oxfordshire, England.

Both of Irons' sons have appeared in films with their father. Irons's wife and children are Catholic; Irons has also been described as a practising Catholic[81] and has stated: I don't go to church much because I don't like belonging to a club, and I don't go to confession or anything like that, I don't believe in it. But I try to be aware of where I fail and I occasionally go to services. I would hate to be a person who didn't have a spiritual side because there's nothing to nourish you in life apart from retail therapy.[82] He owns Kilcoe Castle near Ballydehob, County Cork, Ireland,[83] and had the castle painted a traditional ochre colour which was misreported as being 'pink'.[84] He also has another Irish residence in The Liberties of Dublin, as well as a home in his birth town of Cowes, a family house in Oxfordshire and a mews house in Notting Hill, London.[85]  Irons is fluent in French.[86] In March 2016 Irons told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he would refuse an invitation to the palace to accept a New Year Honour should it ever arrive: "I became an actor to be a rogue and a vagabond so I don't think it would be apt for the establishment to pull me in as one of their own, for I ain't."[87]
