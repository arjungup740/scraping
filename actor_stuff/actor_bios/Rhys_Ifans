Reportedly, in preparation for the role, Ifans did not wash himself or brush his teeth. He played Adrian, the pompous eldest brother in Little Nicky (2000).

Ifans revealed in March 2009 that he was to appear in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (2010).[18] He played Xenophillius Lovegood, editor of the wizarding magazine The Quibbler and father of the eccentric Luna Lovegood. In the same interview, he announced that he would play the title role in the film Mr. Nice, based on the life of the drug smuggler Howard Marks. He played Nemo Nobody's father in Mr. Nobody. He played a villain in Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. On 11 October 2010 Associated Press confirmed that Ifans would portray the villain in the Spider-Man reboot film The Amazing Spider-Man. The villain was revealed as the Curt Connors / Lizard a few days later, and the film was released in July 2012.[19] In 2015, Ifans starred in She's Funny That Way, directed by Peter Bogdanovich. On 16 November 2021 it was revealed, through the film's official trailer, that Ifans would reprise his role as Lizard from The Amazing Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home, to be released on 17 December. Later it was revealed that Ifans was not actually present on set and only lent his voice for the character created through digital means, with his human form at the end of the film being from archival footage from The Amazing Spider-Man.[20][21] Ifans also appeared as Grigori Rasputin in the spy film The King's Man, which was released in December 2021.[citation needed] Ifans was briefly lead vocalist of the rock band Super Furry Animals before they released any records.[22] Since 2007, Ifans has sung with the psychedelic rock band The Peth ("peth" is Welsh for "thing"), featuring Super Furry Animals' Dafydd Ieuan, which played a number of concert dates in south Wales and in London in the autumn of 2008. In 2009 the band supported Oasis at a concert in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.[23] In September 2012, Ifans became a patron of the Welsh-language Wikipedia, together with then Archbishop of Wales Barry Morgan.[24] In 2017, Ifans partnered with Shelter Cymru in a campaign called "7 Ways You Can End Homelessness".[25] He also in 2017 supported the community purchase of Tafarn Sinc, a pub in his native Pembrokeshire facing closure.[26] Ifans lives in London.[8] He dated British actress Anna Friel from 2011 to 2014.[27][28] In 2002, Ifans caused some controversy in the British media for his alleged support of Meibion Glyndŵr, a militant Welsh nationalist group which burnt down more than 100 empty holiday homes in Wales owned by English people in the 1980s. This was mainly due to an interview Mariella Frostrup conducted with him for The Observer in which he said, "Welsh-speaking communities are under threat more than at any other time in history because of house prices. [...] Communities that have been there for centuries are essentially becoming holiday villages. Young people are forced to leave because there's no work and the young people that are left can't afford to live there. That's a crime."[8] During the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, Ifans was arrested for misdemeanour battery by San Diego police after allegedly pushing a guard prior to speaking on a guest panel.[29] The local District Attorney's office announced that Ifans would not be charged due to lack of evidence.[30] In 2005, Ifans won a BAFTA for his portrayal of comedian Peter Cook in the TV film Not Only But Always. On 16 July 2007, he received an Honorary Fellowship of Bangor University, for services to the film industry.[33]
