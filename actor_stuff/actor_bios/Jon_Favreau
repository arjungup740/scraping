However, following his mother's death, both sides of his family worked to ensure he had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony.[9] Favreau graduated from The Bronx High School of Science, a school for gifted students, in 1984[10] and attended Queens College from 1984 to 1987,[11] before dropping out. His friend from college, Mitchell Pollack, said that Favreau went by the nickname "Johnny Hack" because of his abilities in the game Hacky Sack.[12] He briefly worked for Bear Stearns on Wall Street before returning to Queens College for a semester in early 1988.
