Clarke is of Indian ethnic origin on her mother's side of the family; she stated in a 2018 interview that her maternal grandmother was the child of a secret affair between Clarke's great-grandmother and a man from the Indian subcontinent. Her grandmother wore light make-up to hide the darker complexion she had inherited from her father. Clarke credits this background for her family's having a "history of fighters", stating, "The fact that [my grandmother] had to hide her skin colour, essentially, and try desperately to fit in with everyone else must've been incredibly difficult."[6] In an interview with Harper's Bazaar, she stated that her grandmother "loved India more than she loved England" and as such, when she died, 16-year-old Clarke travelled to India to scatter her ashes.[7][1][8] Clarke's older brother, Bennett, works in the entertainment industry and was part of the camera department on Game of Thrones.[9][10] Clarke said she became interested in acting at age three after seeing the musical Show Boat.[11] When she was ten, her father took her to a West End audition for The Goodbye Girl, a musical by Neil Simon.[1] Clarke attended Rye St Antony School in Headington and St Edward's School, Oxford, which she left in 2005.[12] In a 2016 interview with Time Out, she stated "I went to posh boarding schools, but I wasn't the posh girl at the posh boarding schools."[13] She also stated that most of the people at her boarding school in Oxford were from conservative backgrounds, which meant she and some of her friends often felt like outsiders.[14] After graduation, Clarke unsuccessfully applied to RADA, LAMDA, and Guildhall.

Club commented on the difficulty of adapting such an evolution from page to screen, but concluded that Clarke "more than seal[s] the deal here."[34] Clarke said the role of Daenerys was "not your typical bonnet duty that you have to go through as a young British actress".[35] In 2017, she reportedly became one of the highest-paid actors on television, earning between £1.2 and £2 million per episode of Game of Thrones.[a] In 2019, she said she had been uncomfortable acting nude in her first experience at age 23 of a large film set, but had since become "a lot more savvy" about what level of nudity is needed for a scene.[38] Clarke received multiple award nominations and wins for her role of Daenerys.
