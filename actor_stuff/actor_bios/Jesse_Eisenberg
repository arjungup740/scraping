Every morning she had a duck party, she would wake up very early and tune her guitar and warm up her voice, and it taught me that you could take performance seriously. I think a lot of actors have trouble taking things seriously, ... but it's really like anything else in the world ... So it gave me the confidence to take it seriously and not make me feel silly for indulging in a role." — Eisenberg, on the influence his mother's previous job as a children's clown had on his acting[2] Eisenberg[3] was born in Astoria, in the Queens borough of New York City on October 5, 1983, and grew up in East Brunswick, New Jersey.[4] His mother, Amy (née Fishman), who now teaches cross cultural sensitivity in hospitals, previously worked as a clown at children's parties and as a choreographer for a Catholic high school for 20 years.[2][5][6] His father, Barry Eisenberg, drove a taxicab, then worked at a hospital, and later became a college professor, teaching sociology.[7][8][9] He has two sisters: Hallie Eisenberg, a former child actress who was once famous as the "Pepsi girl" in a series of commercials; and Kerri Eisenberg, now Kerry Lea,[10] who also worked as an actress,[11] ran a vegetarianism- and animal rights-based children's theatre troupe,[12] and is now an independent artist in New York.[13] Eisenberg was raised in a secular Jewish household,[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] with his ancestry tracing back to Poland and Ukraine.[21][22] He attended the East Brunswick Public Schools at Frost School, Hammarskjold Middle School, Churchill Junior High School, and spent his sophomore year at East Brunswick High School.[23] He then transferred to the Professional Performing Arts School in New York. When he was a senior, he received his breakthrough role in the independent comedy-drama film Roger Dodger.[7] His work in the film prevented him from enrolling at New York University.[24][25] Instead, he studied anthropology and contemporary architecture at The New School in Greenwich Village,[26] where he majored in liberal arts, with a focus on democracy and cultural pluralism.[25] Eisenberg struggled to fit in at school due to an anxiety disorder, and began acting in plays at an early age.[27] When he was seven he starred as Oliver Twist in a children's theater production of the musical Oliver!, and by 12 he was an understudy in the 1996 Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams' Summer and Smoke. At 13, he understudied the role of Young Scrooge in a musical version of A Christmas Carol starring Tony Randall.[28] He had his first professional role in Arje Shaw's off-Broadway play The Gathering at age 16.[29] He said, "When playing a role, I would feel more comfortable, as you're given a prescribed way of behaving."[30] Eisenberg started writing screenplays at 16, some of which were optioned by major studios, but he claimed that he was dissatisfied with the lack of control he had over his creations once they were sold.[28] He once got into trouble with Woody Allen's lawyers when, as a teenager, he penned a play about how Allen came to change his name and managed to get the script to Allen's "people". Instead of a seal of approval, he received two cease and desist letters. Eisenberg later starred in two films directed by Allen, To Rome with Love[31] and Café Society.[32][33][34] Eisenberg made his television debut in the series Get Real, from 1999 to 2000. In 2001, he appeared in a UK Dr Pepper commercial as "Butt Naked Boy."[35] After appearing in the made-for-television film Lightning: Fire from the Sky at 18, he starred in the independent film Roger Dodger (for which he won an award at the San Diego Film Festival for Most Promising New Actor), and in The Emperor's Club, both of which were released in 2002 to generally positive reviews. Eisenberg was sick for the majority of the nightclub scene and can be seen sweating in different shots.[36] In 2005, Eisenberg appeared in Cursed, a horror film directed by Wes Craven, and The Squid and the Whale, a well-reviewed independent drama starring Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels.[24] In 2007, he starred opposite Richard Gere and Terrence Howard in The Hunting Party, a comic thriller in which he plays an American journalist reporting from Bosnia. In 2009, Eisenberg played the lead role in Adventureland, a comedy directed by Greg Mottola and filmed in Kennywood Park, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Filming wrapped in October 2007,[37] and the film had its premier at the Sundance Film Festival in 2009. In November 2007, Eisenberg was cast in the indie comic-drama Holy Rollers alongside his sister, Hallie Eisenberg, who played his fictional sister in the film. He played a young Hasidic Jew who becomes involved in the ecstasy smuggling trade, using his religion as a disguise to deal without suspicion. Filming took place in New York in 2008.[38] During the late 2000s, he also had roles in the independent films Solitary Man, playing college student Daniel, and Camp Hell, a horror film directed by George Van Buskirk.[39][40] Eisenberg's first major box office success was a lead role in the horror-comedy Zombieland (2009). He starred opposite Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin as a group of survivors on a road trip through a post-zombie apocalypse America, and was a sleeper hit.[41] In 2010, he portrayed Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg in the film The Social Network, for which he earned the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures,[42] and nominations for Best Actor at the BAFTA Awards, Golden Globes, and Academy Awards but lost to Colin Firth for his permformance of George VI in The King's Speech. According to the film's director, David Fincher, both he and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin knew Eisenberg was the one for the role as soon as they watched his audition tape, despite Eisenberg's own anxieties about his audition.[43] On November 22, 2010, Eisenberg was honored, along with Whoopi Goldberg, Joycelyn Engle, and Harvey Krueger, at the Children at Heart Celebrity Dinner Gala and Fantasy Auction, to benefit the children of the Chernobyl disaster. Steven Spielberg serves as Chair of the event each year.[21] On January 29, 2011, Eisenberg hosted Saturday Night Live on NBC, with musical guest Nicki Minaj. During his opening monologue, Zuckerberg himself appeared.[44] Eisenberg said that meeting the man he portrayed on-screen was "an overwhelming experience," and was happy that "we were both able to have fun at the situation."[45] Zuckerberg, who has complained frequently about the artistic licenses taken by The Social Network, would later say that he thought Eisenberg "was a little afraid to meet me after his portrayal, but I tried to be nice."[46] In 2011, he starred in the box-office animated hit Rio, as the main character Blu, a metropolitan, domesticated male Spix's macaw who learns how to fly. He starred alongside Anne Hathaway, his former co-star (and onscreen sibling) from Get Real,[47] as well as George Lopez, Tracy Morgan, will.i.am, and Jamie Foxx.[48] He featured in one song, "Real in Rio", in the film's soundtrack, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.[49] He also starred alongside Aziz Ansari, Danny McBride, and Nick Swardson in 30 Minutes or Less, a film noir heist-comedy about a pizza delivery man, played by Eisenberg, who is forced to rob a bank, which was released in August 2011.[50] In October 2011, Eisenberg made his playwriting debut in Rattlestick Playwrights Theater's Off-Broadway production of Asuncion, staged at Cherry Lane Theatre. Eisenberg also acted in the play, which was directed by Kip Fagan. The play highlights two overeducated, liberal-minded friends, played by Eisenberg and Justin Bartha, whose assumptions are challenged by their new Filipina roommate, played by Camille Mana.[51][52] In 2012, he starred alongside Melissa Leo in Why Stop Now, a drama about a drug addict mother (Leo) and her piano prodigy son (Eisenberg),[53] and in the magical realist romantic comedy To Rome with Love, directed by Woody Allen.[54] That same year, he filed a $3 million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed to appear in the film as a favor to his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000,[55] and logged only a few minutes of total screen time.[56] Because of his minimal involvement in the production, he was surprised to see that his face was prominently featured on the cover of the DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.[57] In 2013, Eisenberg reunited with Woody Harrelson for the magician heist thriller Now You See Me, playing a world-famous close-up magician and street performer recruited into a secret group of elite magicians to pull off bank heists with magic tricks, redistributing the money from a wealthy businessman (Michael Caine) to victims of his corrupt capitalist schemes. That year he announced his plan to continue writing, for both stage and screen, as well as continuing to act.[58] He debuted his second play, The Revisionist,[59] and starred in Richard Ayoade's drama, The Double (2013), which was shot in 2012.[60] In the following years, Eisenberg reprised his role as Blu in Rio 2 (2014),[61] and starred alongside Kristen Stewart in the action comedy American Ultra (2015), playing a rogue sleeper agent being chased by the C.I.A.[62] In 2015, Eisenberg portrayed Rolling Stone journalist David Lipsky in the biographical drama film The End of the Tour, appearing opposite Jason Segel, who portrayed the late author David Foster Wallace.[63] Eisenberg's third play, The Spoils, premiered off-Broadway in The New Group Perishing Square Signature Center Alice Griffin Box Theatre. The play featuring Eisenberg as Ben, also starring Kunal Nayyar, Michael Zegen, Erin Darke, and Annapurna Sriram, was the winner of The Blanche and Irving Laurie Foundation Theatre Visions Fund Award.[64] On September 8, 2015, Eisenberg released his first book, Bream Gives Me Hiccups, a collection of short humor pieces.[1][59] Eisenberg serves on the Board of Advisors for Playing On Air, a public radio show/podcast that works with contemporary playwrights to produce plays for "today's digital audience."[65] He has written one short play for Playing On Air, called A Little Part of All of Us (2015), which he starred in with Justin Bartha.[66] He has voiced for two other plays, The Final Interrogation of Ceaucescu's Dog (2015), written by Warren Leight, and The Blizzard (2016), written by David Ives and directed by John Rando.[67][68] Eisenberg played the supervillain Lex Luthor in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,[69][70] which was released in March 2016, to generally negative reviews.[69][71] His performance in particular was criticized by comic book fans and film reviewers,[72] later earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor.[73] He defended himself by saying he attempted to "make these people real and relatable and interesting and engaging."[74] Eisenberg then reunited with Woody Allen and Kristen Stewart in Café Society.[32][75][76][77][78] The film held its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 11, 2016.[79] Eisenberg next reprised his role as street magician J. Daniel "Danny" Atlas in Now You See Me 2, which was released on June 10, 2016, previewed June 9, to mixed reviews.[80][81] The film was shot primarily in London and Macau.[82][83] It grossed over $267 million worldwide,[84][85] and Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer announced that they had "already begun early planning for Now You See Me 3.[86] On June 2, 2016, Eisenberg's play The Spoils began a run at London's Trafalgar Studios in the West End, with Scott Elliott returning to direct.[87] Eisenberg again played the lead role, along with Nayyar and Sriram, while Zegen and Darke's characters were replaced by Alfie Allen and Katie Brayben respectively.[88] In May 2016, Eisenberg teased that he would reprise his role of Lex Luthor in the Justice League film (2017).[89][90] An official press kit, released by Warner Bros. on December 22, 2016, confirmed the return.[91] He appeared as Luthor in the post-credits scene alongside Joe Manganiello, who played Slade Wilson/Deathstroke. Eisenberg is a producer on Jeremy Workman's 2018 documentary The World Before Your Feet, which follows a 37-year-old man named Matt Green who has walked over 9,000 miles on the streets of New York City. In an interview with Variety, Eisenberg talked about the film, stating, "it’s this fantastic tour of New York City.

He's simultaneously a tourist and a philosopher."[92] The documentary premiered to critical acclaim at the 2018 South by Southwest Film Festival where it was acquired by distributor Greenwich Entertainment.[93] It was released theatrically in November 2018[94] and has an approval rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.[95] The same month he appeared in the Serbian TV series Žigosani u reketu as the owner of an NBA club.[96] In 2019, Eisenberg starred in the sequel Zombieland: Double Tap, directed by Ruben Fleischer.[97] Writers of the first Zombieland, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, penned the script with David Callaham.[98][99][100] Eisenberg is writing and directing a comedy adaptation of Bream Gives Me Hiccups with Jax Media, starring Parker Posey, Victor Rasuk, and Elliott Smith.

They re-launched the site in 2010, instead exclusively formatted for Facebook users.[125][126] Despite portraying Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in one of his most prominent film roles, Eisenberg does not use social media and said in 2016, "I'm terrified of that stuff. I live inside a bubble on purpose."[6] When asked if he used Facebook to prepare for his role as Zuckerberg, he said that he "signed on for, like, 20 seconds one time".[6] Eisenberg has become deeply involved with the city of Bloomington, Indiana, having shown support for Indiana University Bloomington and donating thousands of dollars to Bloomington's Middle Way House.[127] He lived in the city at one point during the COVID-19 pandemic.[128] Eisenberg is also an alumnus of the Bloomington Playwrights Project.[129] He is a fan of the Indiana Pacers basketball team.[130] For an article he wrote for InStyle magazine, he played a game of one-on-one with an Indiana University MVP point guard.[131] He is also a long-time fan of the Indy Thunder beep baseball team and its founder Darnell Booker.[132] Eisenberg collaborated with Child Mind Institute in their #MyYoungerSelf project, where "each day in May a prominent individual will speak to his or her younger self about growing up with a mental health or learning disorder."

It's saved so many lives."[138] In an interview with Variety in March 2018, Eisenberg stated that he has raised almost $1 million for the shelter.[92] Eisenberg is a cast member with Theater of War, a performing arts non-profit that presents readings of Sophocles's Ajax and Philoctetes to military and civilian communities across the United States and Europe.[139] "As an actor, sometimes you feel limited by the role you're in; stories without much meaning. [Theatre of War] allows you do something that has more substance and benefits people ... It's a greater purpose than just entertainment," Eisenberg said of the organization.[140] Eisenberg also works in performing for Voices of a People's History of the United States, which is an organization that works to "encourage civic engagement and to further history education by bringing the rich history of the United States to life through public readings of primary source materials."[141] He read Howard Zinn's "The Problem is Civil Obedience" (1970) for Voices of a People's History as part of "NYU Portraits" 2011 event.[142] Eisenberg is involved with Keep America Beautiful, which "[engages] individuals to take greater responsibility for improving their community environments,"[143] as well as Shoe Revolt, a "hybrid start-up company that auctions celeb shoes to raise funds to deploy a social franchising model which aims to educate, engage, and empower youth to take the lead in the fight against domestic sex trafficking through peer-to-peer involvement, training, activism and social enterprise development."[144] On September 12, 2016, Eisenberg, Cate Blanchett, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Peter Capaldi, Douglas Booth, Neil Gaiman, Keira Knightley, Juliet Stevenson, Kit Harington, and Stanley Tucci were featured in a video from the United Nations' refugee agency UNHCR to help raise awareness about the global refugee crisis.
