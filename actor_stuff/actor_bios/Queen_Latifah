Nature of a Sista' (1991) was her second and final album with Tommy Boy Records. Latifah starred as Khadijah James on the Fox sitcom Living Single from 1993 to 1998. Her third album, Black Reign (1993), became the first female rap album to receive a RIAA certification,[2] and spawned the single "U.N.I.T.Y.", which was influential in raising awareness of violence against women and the objectification of Black female sexuality.[3] The record won a Grammy Award and peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. She then starred in the lead role of Set It Off (1996) and released her fourth album, Order in the Court, on June 16, 1998, with Motown Records. Latifah garnered acclaim with her role of Matron "Mama" Morton in the musical film Chicago (2002), receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Latifah released her fifth album The Dana Owens Album in 2004. In 2007 and 2009, she released two more studio albums – Trav'lin' Light and Persona. She created the daytime talk show The Queen Latifah Show, which ran from 1999 to 2001, and again from 2013 to 2015, in syndication.

Queen Latifah has often been cited as a female rap pioneer, and as "rap's first feminist".[5] Latifah became the first hip hop artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (2006). She was also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2011. Latifah's work in music, film and television has earned her a Grammy Award, an Emmy Award, a Golden Globe Award, three Screen Actors Guild Awards, two NAACP Image Awards, and an Academy Award nomination. Dana Elaine Owens was born in Newark, New Jersey, on March 18, 1970, and lived primarily in East Orange, New Jersey. She is the daughter of Rita Lamae (née Bray; d. 2018),[6] a teacher at Irvington High School (Latifah's alma mater), and Lancelot Amos Owens, a police officer.[7][8][9] Owens attended Essex Catholic Girls' High School in Irvington, but graduated from Irvington High School.[10][11][12] Her parents divorced when Latifah was ten.[12] Latifah was raised in the Baptist faith[13] and attended Catholic school in Newark, New Jersey.[14][15] She found her stage name, Latifah (لطيفة laţīfa), meaning "delicate" and "very kind" in Arabic, in a book of Arabic names when she was eight.[12] Always tall, the 5-foot-10-inch (1.78 m) Latifah was a power forward on her high school basketball team.[16][17] She performed the number "Home" from the musical The Wiz in a grammar school play.[18] After high school, Queen Latifah attended classes at Borough of Manhattan Community College.[19] She began beat boxing for the hip-hop group Ladies Fresh and was an original member of the Flavor Unit, which, at that time, was a crew of MCs grouped around producer DJ King Gemini, who made a demo recording of Queen Latifah's rap Princess of the Posse. He gave the recording to Fab 5 Freddy, the host of Yo! MTV Raps. The song got the attention of Tommy Boy Music employee Dante Ross, who signed Latifah and in 1989 issued her first single, "Wrath of My Madness". More recent artists, like Ice Cube and Lil' Kim, would go on to sample Latifah's track in their songs, "Wrath of Kim's Madness" and "You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo" in later years.[20] Latifah has a two-octave vocal range.[21] She is considered a contralto, having the ability to both rap and sing.[21] Latifah made her mark in hip-hop by rapping about issues surrounding being a black woman. Her songs covered topics including domestic violence, harassment on the streets, and relationship problems.[22]
Freddy helped Latifah sign with Tommy Boy Records, which released Latifah's first album All Hail the Queen in 1989, when she was nineteen.[12] That year, she appeared as Referee on the UK label Music of Life album 1989 – The Hustlers Convention (live). She received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1992.[23] In 1993, she released the album Black Reign, which was certified Gold in the United States[24] and produced the Grammy Award-winning song "U.N.I.T.Y." In 1998, co-produced by Ro Smith, now CEO of Def Ro Inc., she released her fourth hip-hop album Order in the Court, which was released by Motown Records. Latifah was also a member of the hip-hop collective Native Tongues. Latifah performed in the Super Bowl XXXII halftime show, making her the first rapper to do so.[25] After Order in the Court, Latifah shifted primarily to singing soul music and jazz standards, which she had used sparingly in her previous hip-hop-oriented records. In 2004, she released the soul/jazz standards The Dana Owens Album. On July 11, 2007, Latifah sang at the famed Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles as the headlining act in a live jazz concert. In front of a crowd of more than 12,400, she was backed by a 10-piece live orchestra and three backup vocalists, which was billed as the Queen Latifah Orchestra. Latifah performed new arrangements of standards including "California Dreaming", first made popular by 1960s icons the Mamas & the Papas. Later in 2007, Latifah released an album titled Trav'lin' Light. Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Joe Sample, George Duke, Christian McBride, and Stevie Wonder made guest appearances.[26] It was nominated for a Grammy in the "Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album" category.[27] In 2009, Latifah, along with the NJPAC Jubilation Choir,[28] recorded the title track on the album Oh, Happy Day: An All-Star Music Celebration, covering the song that the Edwin Hawkins Singers made popular in 1969.[29] In 2008, Latifah was asked if she would make another hip-hop album. She was quoted stating that the album was done already and it would be called All Hail the Queen II. The following year, in 2009, she released her album Persona. The song "Cue the Rain" was released as the album's lead single.[30] 2011 saw Queen Latifah sing "Who Can I Turn To" in a duet with Tony Bennett for his album Duets II.[31] In January 2012, while appearing on 106 & Park with Dolly Parton, to promote Joyful Noise, Latifah stated that she had been working on a new album. She began her film career in supporting roles in the 1991 and 1992 films House Party 2, Juice and Jungle Fever. Moreover, she has guest starred in two episodes during the second season (1991–1992) of the NBC hit The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and had a guest role as herself on Hangin' with Mr. Cooper in 1993.

The third season titled Scream: Resurrection premiered on July 8, 2019.[43] Latifah played the sea witch Ursula in The Little Mermaid Live!.

She possesses a two-octave vocal range. Queen Latifah is a contralto, and she has the ability to rap and sing. Her biggest musical influences are EPMD, KRS-One, LL Cool J, Public Enemy, and Run–D.M.C.[49] She also cites Bessie Smith as one of her influences.[50] Al Hail the Queen features hip-hop, reggae, soulful back-up vocals, boppish scatting, snappy horn back-ups, and house music. She described the work as "a creative outlet... and sometimes it can become like a newspaper that people read with their ears."[51] Early in her career, Queen Latifah's lyrics were described as woman-centered and Afrocentric. The rapper often used Afrocentric attires during public appearances and music videos, looks that became her trademark.[52] In 1990, The New York Times' Michelle Wallace described her art as "politically sophisticated", which "seems worlds apart from the adolescent, buffoonish sex orientation of most rap."[53] For AllMusic, her "strong, intelligent, no-nonsense" persona made her "arguably the first MC who could properly be described as feminist".[2] Queen Latifah did not identify as a feminist at the time, and expressed that her music was not exclusive for the female audience.[54] On the topic, author Tricia Rose wrote that Black female rappers likely did not identify with feminism during that time because it was perceived as a movement that focused primarily on white women's issues.[55] Latifah is a celebrity spokesperson for CoverGirl cosmetics, Curvation women's underwear, Pizza Hut, and Jenny Craig.[56] She represents her own line of cosmetics for women of color called the CoverGirl Queen Collection.[57] Latifah has also launched a perfume line called "Queen" and "Queen of Hearts". On May 23, 2018, Latifah was named the godmother of Carnival Cruise Lines' vessel Carnival Horizon. Apart from singing, Queen Latifah has written a book on confidence and self-respect called Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman.[58] Raised in East Orange, New Jersey, Latifah has been a resident of Colts Neck, New Jersey; Rumson, New Jersey; and Beverly Hills, California.[59] Latifah's older brother, Lancelot Jr., was killed in 1992 in an accident involving a motorcycle that Latifah had purchased for him.[12] A 2006 interview revealed that Latifah still wears the key to the motorcycle around her neck,[12] visible throughout her performance in her sitcom Living Single. She also dedicated Black Reign to him. In her 1999 autobiography, Ladies First: Revelations of a Strong Woman, Latifah discussed how her brother's death had led to a bout of depression and drug abuse, from which she later recovered. In 1995, Latifah was the victim of a carjacking, which also resulted in the shooting of her boyfriend, Sean Moon.[60] In 1996, she was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and possession of a loaded handgun.[61] In 2002, she was arrested for driving under the influence in Los Angeles County.[62] She was placed on three years' probation after being convicted.[63] On March 21, 2018, her mother, actress Rita Owens, died due to heart failure, an issue she had been battling since 2004.[64] 
Latifah has long refused to address speculation around her sexuality and personal life. In 2008 she told The New York Times; "I don't feel like I need to share my personal life, and I don't care if people think I'm gay or not".[65]  At the BET Awards 2021, during her acceptance speech for the Lifetime Achievement Award, she publicly acknowledged her partner Eboni Nichols and son Rebel for the first time, ending the speech with "happy Pride!" acknowledging that she identifies with LGBT.[66] Disagreements between Foxy Brown and Queen Latifah began in mid-1996, where media reports indicated that Brown was a prime target in Latifah's diss record "Name Callin'", which was featured in the movie soundtrack Set It Off.[67] In response, Brown made allegations of Latifah "checking her out" at musical events and had even gone further to question Latifah's sexuality in various public radio interviews. In 1998, Brown released a diss record titled "10% Dis," where she continually questioned Latifah's sexuality and accused her of being jealous.[68][69] By late spring of 1998, Latifah responded to Brown through another diss record titled, "Name Callin' Part II."[70][71] In the record, Latifah disses Brown about her heavy reliance on sex-appeal, in which she implies that Brown has to rely on skimpy outfits to hide her "half-assed flow".[70][72] Foxy Brown retaliated via a response-diss record titled "Talk to Me", in which Brown made fun of the ratings of Latifah's television talk show and went on to make various homophobic remarks to both Latifah and then-newcomer Queen Pen.[73] A significant part of media dubbed Latifah as "the winner" of the feud.[71] Hip-hop magazine ego trip stated that Latifah won the feud with her diss record "Name Callin' Part II" and added that she showed that "the lady's still first", in reference to Latifah's 1990 single, "Ladies First".[71] In 2000, Brown and Latifah reconciled; to prove that the truce was real, Brown performed her song "Na Na Be Like" on The Queen Latifah Show.[74] During the 1990s and 2000s several media outlets dubbed Queen Latifah as the "Queen of Rap"[75], as well as the "Queen of Hip Hop".[76][77] Dinitia Smith as editor for New York magazine (1990) called her the "Queen of Rap" in her profile article.[5] In the book Notable Black American Women, Jessie Carney Smith considered her "rap's first feminist" and "one of the few women to make a mark in the male-dominated field of rap music".[5] She has also been dubbed as the "Queen of Jazz-Rap". Variety called her "one of the major forerunners for women in modern hip-hop,"[78] and The Guardian considered her "a pioneer of female rap."[79] AllMusic writer Steve Huey stated that Latifah was "certainly not the first female rapper, but she was the first one to become a bona fide star;" Latifah became the first female rapper to receive a RIAA certification for an album (Black Reign), a commercial breakthrough that the editor considered created a path for "a talented crew of women rappers to make their own way onto the charts as the 90s progressed".[2] Her breakthrough also helped place New Jersey on the hip hop map.[52] According to an African American Review journal, her afrocentric feminist music video for "Ladies First" presented a "televisual moment" and disrupted the continuity of sexism and racism that dominated the music videos at the time.[80] The song was listed on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll,[81] and was one of the firsts texts to address the declining standards of male female relationships in community life.[55] Author Tricia Rose expressed that it "offered hip-hop for the development of pro-female pro-black diasporas political consciousness."[55] In Consequence, Okla Jones noted that the song "U.N.I.T.Y."—which lyrics confront slurs against women in hip-hop culture and address other types of disrespect—created a path for future female rappers to be "their authentic selves".[82] Queen Latifah became an influence to R&B, soul, and hip-hop artists, such as Eve,[83] Da Brat,[84] Lil' Kim,[85] Fugees,[86] Jill Scott,[87] Lauryn Hill,[88] Missy Elliott,[89] Remy Ma,[90] Ivy Queen,[91] Foxy Brown,[92] Ms. Dynamite,[93] and Naughty by Nature.[94] Queen Latifah became the first female hip-hop recording artist to get nominated for an Oscar. In 2006, Queen Latifah became the first hip-hop artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,[95] and was also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2011.[96] In her music career, Queen Latifah has sold nearly 2 million albums in the US.[97][98] The Root ranked her at number 35 on The Root 100 list.[99] She is a recipient of a Grammy Award from six nominations, a Golden Globe Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards from five nominations, two NAACP Image Awards from thirteen nominations, one Primetime Emmy Award from three nominations, and an Academy Award nomination. In 2021, she received the BET Lifetime Achievement Award.[100] Studio albums Latifah, Jill Scott and Erykah Badu joined to create and own the rights to the Sugar Water Festival Tour, LLC.
