A video of the event was posted on YouTube and became a viral success.[15][16] A clip from the performance was also played during Cuoco's January 8, 2013 appearance on the late-night talk show Conan.[17] Cuoco starred in the Lifetime film To Be Fat like Me, which premiered on January 8, 2007.[18] She played a minor role in the Prison Break episodes "The Message" and "Chicago", as well as starring in the comedy horror spoof Killer Movie in 2008.

Television. Cuoco's first project through Yes, Norman was an adaptation of the book The Flight Attendant, written by author Chris Bohjalian, which was developed into a comedy-drama series of the same name. Cuoco starred in the series as Cassie Bowden, and also served as executive producer.[25] The Flight Attendant premiered on November 26, 2020, on WarnerMedia's streaming platform HBO Max to widespread critical acclaim, and was renewed for a second season on December 18, 2020.[26][3][27] In October 2018, it was announced that Cuoco would voice the title character of the DC Universe adult animation series Harley Quinn, and also serve as executive producer.[28] The series premiered on November 29, 2019, to critical acclaim.[29] In September 2020, it was announced that the series was renewed for a third season and would move to HBO Max.[30] In August 2019, it was announced that Cuoco would executive produce the upcoming CBS comedy Pretty, which is written and also executive produced by Lindsey Kraft and Santina Muha.[31] In April 2020, Cuoco joined the cast of the upcoming action comedy film The Man from Toronto as the female lead alongside Kevin Hart and Woody Harrelson.[32] In March 2021, it was announced that Cuoco would play Doris Day in an upcoming limited series based on A.

She will also serve as an executive producer of the series.[33] Two months later, her production company expanded its Warner overall deal.[34] In 2007, while working on The Big Bang Theory, Cuoco privately dated co-star Johnny Galecki for roughly two years, until December 2009. She later told CBS Watch in September 2010 that they have remained on good terms since ending their relationship.[35] On September 13, 2010, Cuoco broke her leg in a horse-riding accident and missed the filming of two episodes of The Big Bang Theory.[36] In October 2011, she became engaged to addiction specialist Josh Resnik, but ended their engagement by March 2012.[37] She became engaged to professional tennis player Ryan Sweeting in September 2013, after three months of dating. They married on December 31, 2013, in Santa Susana, California.[38] On September 25, 2015, it was announced that she and Sweeting had decided to divorce.[39] The divorce was finalized on May 9, 2016.[40] In December 2014, Cuoco received significant media attention surrounding a remark she made in an interview with Redbook magazine while married to Ryan Sweeting. When asked if she considered herself a feminist, she responded: "Is it bad if I say no? I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that's because I've never really faced inequality... I cook for Ryan five nights a week: it makes me feel like a housewife. I love that. I know it sounds old-fashioned, but I like the idea of women taking care of their men".[41][42] In an interview in March 2016, Cuoco said she felt her words were misconstrued, telling Cosmopolitan magazine, "Of course I'm a fucking feminist. Look at me. I bleed feminism: I get equal pay to my male co stars on a big show, I have my own home, I'm as independent as you could possibly be. Maybe I didn't understand the question, but for me that's feminism. I'm killing the game, man".[43][44] Cuoco began dating equestrian Karl Cook, son of billionaire Scott Cook, in late 2016.[45][46] They became engaged on November 30, 2017, Cuoco's 32nd birthday,[47] and were married on June 30, 2018.[48] In September 2021, the couple announced their separation, stating "we have realized that our current paths have taken us in opposite directions".[49]
