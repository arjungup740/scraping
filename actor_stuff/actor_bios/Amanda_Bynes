More importantly, we like her."[26] Magazine Bustle wrote in 2018: "She's The Man was hot and hilarious and anxiety-inducing. It was perfect, and Bynes was a revelation in it."

I learned about both [Judaism and Catholicism]. My parents said it was up to me to decide [which faith to adhere to] when I grew up. I'm sort of a spiritual person anyway. I haven't decided yet [on a religion]. I don't know yet exactly what I believe."[7] Since childhood, Bynes has been interested in illustration and fashion design.[16] In December 2013, Bynes enrolled at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising in Irvine for 2014.[51][52] In 2018, she received her Associate's of Art degree in Merchandise Product Development and announced her intentions to start a bachelor's degree program.[11] In 2019, Bynes graduated from FIDM.[53] In 2008, Bynes briefly dated Seth MacFarlane after voicing a character in an episode of MacFarlane's show Family Guy.[54] In 2020, on her Instagram page, she announced her engagement to Paul Michael.[55][56] Three weeks later, it was announced that they broke off the relationship, but this announcement was later revealed to be false.

She was hospitalized under a 72-hour mental-health evaluation hold.[63] Bynes's parents filed for conservatorship of their daughter shortly after her hospitalization began.[64] In August, Bynes's mother was granted a temporary conservatorship over Bynes's affairs.[65] In October 2014, Bynes accused her father of emotional and sexual abuse in a series of tweets; when her parents protested their innocence, Bynes tweeted that her father had never abused her, but "The microchip in my brain made me say those things but he's the one that ordered them to microchip me".[66][67]
Days later, Bynes's mother again received conservatorship.[68] Soon afterward, Bynes announced that she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.[69] In August 2018, paperwork was filed to continue said conservatorship until August 2020.[70][71] In 2018, Bynes stated she had been sober for four years with the help of her parents.[11] She also apologized for what she said on Twitter during her years of substance abuse: "I'm really ashamed and embarrassed with the things I said. I can't turn back time but if I could, I would. And I'm so sorry to whoever I hurt and whoever I lied about because it truly eats away at me."[11] In an interview, Bynes stated that during her days of substance abuse she would experiment with cocaine and MDMA, but the drug she "abused the most" was the ADHD prescription medication Adderall.[72]
