Drew Blythe Barrymore was born in Culver City, California, to American actor John Drew Barrymore and aspiring actress Jaid Barrymore (born Ildikó Jaid Makó),[6] who was born in a displaced persons camp in Brannenburg, West Germany, to Hungarian World War II refugees.[7][8] Through her father, Barrymore has three older half-siblings, including actor John Blyth Barrymore.[9] Her parents divorced in 1984, when Barrymore was nine.[1] Barrymore was born into an acting family. All of her paternal great-grandparents, Maurice and Georgie Drew Barrymore, Maurice and Mae Costello (née Altschuk), and her paternal grandparents, John and Dolores Costello, were actors,[10] with John being arguably the most acclaimed actor of his generation.[1][11] Barrymore is a niece of Diana, a grandniece of Lionel, Ethel and Helene Costello,[12] and a great-great-granddaughter of Irish-born John and English-born Louisa Lane Drew, all of whom were also actors. She is a great-grandniece of Broadway idol John Drew, Jr., and silent film actor, writer and director Sidney Drew.[13] Barrymore's godmothers are actress Sophia Loren[14] and Lee Strasberg's widow, Anna Strasberg; Barrymore described her relationship with the latter as one that "would become so important to me as a kid because she was so kind and nurturing."[15] Her godfather is director Steven Spielberg.[16][17][18][19] Barrymore's first name, Drew, was the maiden name of her paternal great-grandmother Georgie Drew, and her middle name, Blythe, was the surname of the family first used by her great-grandfather Maurice Barrymore.[16] In her 1991 autobiography Little Girl Lost, Barrymore recounted early memories of her abusive father, who left the family when she was six months old. She and her father never had anything resembling a significant relationship and seldom spoke to each other.[20] Barrymore grew up on Poinsettia Place in West Hollywood until the age of seven, when she moved to Sherman Oaks. In her 2015 memoir, Wildflower, she says she talks "like a valley girl" because she grew up in Sherman Oaks. She moved back to West Hollywood upon becoming emancipated at age fourteen.[21] Barrymore attended elementary school at Fountain Day School in West Hollywood and Country School.[22] In the wake of her sudden stardom, Barrymore endured a notoriously troubled childhood. She was a regular at Studio 54 as a young girl, and her nightlife and constant partying became a popular subject with the media. She was placed in rehab at the age of 13,[1][16] and spent eighteen months in an institution for the mentally ill.[23] A suicide attempt at 14 put her back in rehab, followed by a three-month stay with singer David Crosby and his wife. The stay was precipitated, Crosby said, because she "needed to be around some people that were committed to sobriety." Barrymore described the period of her life for Little Girl Lost. After a successful juvenile court petition for emancipation, she moved into her own apartment at the age of fifteen.[20][11] Her career began at eleven months, when she appeared in a dog-food commercial. She was nipped by her canine co-star, to which she merely laughed and was hired for the job. After her film debut with a small role in Altered States,[1] she played Gertie in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Spielberg felt that she had the right imagination for her role after she impressed him with a story that she led a punk rock band.[24] E.T. was the highest-grossing film of the 1980s and made her one of the most famous child actors of the time. Barrymore won a Young Artist Award for Best Supporting Actress.[16][25] In the eighth season of Saturday Night Live, Barrymore became the youngest person to appear as a guest-host of the series. In the 1984 horror film adaptation for Stephen King's 1980 novel Firestarter, Barrymore played a girl with pyrokinesis who becomes the target of a secret government agency known as The Shop. That same year, she played a young girl divorcing her famous parents in Irreconcilable Differences, and she was nominated for her first Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.[16][26] In a review in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert stated, "Barrymore is the right actress for this role precisely because she approaches it with such grave calm."[27] Barrymore endured a troubled youth and continued acting during the decade. She starred in the anthology horror film Cat's Eye, also written by King. The film received positive reviews and Barrymore was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress.[28] She was offered a role of Cecile for Dangerous Liaisons, but it went to Uma Thurman.

Barrymore played the younger sister of a murdered ballerina in No Place to Hide and a writer followed by what is apparently her evil twin in Doppelganger. Both films were panned by critics and failed to find an audience.[36][37][38] She appeared in the western film Bad Girls, which follows four former prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and prison escape. Roger Ebert, in his review for the film, wrote for Chicago Sun-Times: "What a good idea, to make a Western about four tough women. And what a sad movie."[39] Barrymore posed nude for the January 1995 issue of Playboy.[40][41] Director Steven Spielberg, who is also her godfather, gave her a quilt for her 20th birthday with a note that read, "Cover yourself up."[16] Enclosed were copies of her Playboy pictures; the pictures had been altered by his art department so that she appeared fully clothed.[42] While appearing in the Late Show with David Letterman, Barrymore climbed onto the desk, flashed her breasts to David Letterman and gave him a kiss on the cheek as a birthday present.[11] She modeled in a series of Guess? jeans ads during this time.[43] In Boys on the Side, Barrymore played a pregnant girl who attempts to escape from her abusive boyfriend.[44] The film went little-seen in theaters but was positively received by critics.[45] In the superhero film Batman Forever, she played one of the two female assistants for Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones).[46][47] Barrymore made a brief but notable appearance in Wes Craven's slasher film Scream.

While reviews from critics were mixed, CNN noted: "There are two words which describe why this film works: Drew Barrymore. Her comedic timing and willingness to go all out in her quest for a laugh combine to make Never Been Kissed a gratifying movie-going experience".[60] The film was a commercial success, grossing $84.5 million.[61] In Charlie's Angels, Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu played the trio of investigators in Los Angeles. The film was a major box office success and helped solidify the standing between Barrymore and the company[clarification needed].[16][62] Barrymore starred in Riding in Cars with Boys, as a teenage mother in a failed marriage with the drug-addicted father (based on Beverly Donofrio's real-life story).[1] When the production of Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko was threatened, Barrymore stepped forward with financing from the company, and played the title character's English teacher.
