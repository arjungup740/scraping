Moss was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Ronald Charles Moss and Linda Ekstrom Moss, both of whom were musicians; her mother plays jazz and blues harmonica professionally.[6][7] Moss has one younger brother.[8] She was raised a Scientologist.[9] Her father is English.[10] Her mother is of part Swedish descent.[11] Initially, Moss aspired to be a professional dancer.[8] In her adolescence, she traveled to New York City to study ballet at the School of American Ballet, after which she studied with Suzanne Farrell at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.[6] She continued to study dance through her teenage years, but started getting acting roles as well. To manage her education and career, she began homeschooling, and graduated in 1999.[6] Moss's first screen role was in 1990, when she appeared in the NBC miniseries Lucky/Chances.[12] From 1992 until 1995, she appeared as Cynthia Parks in seven episodes of the TV series Picket Fences.[12] She provided the voice of Holly DeCarlo, a main character in the TV special Frosty Returns (1992) and of Michelle in the animated film Once Upon a Forest (1993).

It required Zoey to be a bit of a pain with her fancy French boyfriend, but Moss always made her relatable, even when the plot required otherwise."[14] In 1999, she had a supporting role as a patient in a mental institution in James Mangold's Girl, Interrupted, opposite Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie,[12] and a minor part in the drama Anywhere but Here. The same year, she had a small role in the movie Mumford (1999), playing the daughter of a woman with a shopping addiction. In 2002, Moss appeared in a commercial for Excedrin in which she directly addressed the audience about the medication's benefits for people who suffer from migraines. The spot proved enduringly popular and ran for several years, providing Moss with residual income as she struggled to make it as an actor.[15] 
Moss appeared in Heart of America and three other films in 2004. That year, she made the movie Virgin,[12] for which she was nominated for a 2004 Independent Spirit Award.
