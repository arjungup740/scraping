Sarandon was born in Jackson Heights, Queens in New York City.[3] She is the eldest of nine children of Lenora Marie (née Criscione 1923-2020)[4][5] and Phillip Leslie Tomalin, an advertising executive, television producer, and one-time nightclub singer. She has four brothers: Phillip Leslie Jr., Terry (an accomplished outdoorsman, journalist, and community leader), Timothy, and O'Brian; and four sisters: Meredith (or "Merry"), Bonnie Priscilla, Amanda and Melissa (or "Missy").[6][7] Her father was of English, Irish, and Welsh ancestry.[8] His English ancestors came from Hackney in London and his Welsh ancestors from Bridgend. On her mother's side, she is of Italian descent, with ancestors from the regions of Tuscany and Sicily.[6][9][10] Her father worked for WOR-TV in New York City.[11] When she was four years old,[11] the Tomalin family moved from New York City and purchased a house at 34 Williams Road in the newly-developed Stephenville community, located in the northern area of Edison Township, New Jersey (then named Raritan Township).[12][13] The family was raised Roman Catholic and she and her sisters attended the all-girl Saint Francis Grammar School in nearby Borough of Metuchen,[11][14][15] while her brothers attended the all-boy Saint Matthews Grammar School in the southern area of Edison Township.[16][17] Her mother was a member and board director of the Stephenville Women's Club and the Terra Tova Garden Club.[18][13] The family was also member to the Woodside Swim Club, a private swimming club and park in the Stephenville community,[11] where Sarandon and her sisters won many swimming competitions.[11][19][20][21] Sarandon graduated from Saint Francis Grammar School on June 12, 1960.[22] Sarandon attended Edison High School, a public school located in the southern half of Edison Township.[23][24][11] On April 11, 1962, while still in high school and performing under the name Sue Tomalin, she joined a band and dance group to entertain sick children at the Middlesex Rehabilitation and Polio Hospital in North Brunswick, New Jersey.[25] While a junior at Edison High School, she performed the lead in the play Lady Precious Dream.[11][26] While a senior at Edison High School, she played the title character lead in the comedy play My Sister Eileen in November 1963, earning mentions and her picture in the local newspapers.[27][28] On March 24, 1964, Sarandon was inducted into the National Honor Society by Edison Township High School.[29] In May 1964, the Tomalin family sold their house on Williams Road in Stephenville and purchased a home at 5 Dorset Way in the newly-developed Chandler Hill community, just east of Stephenville in Edison.[30][11][31][26] Sarandon graduated from Edison High School on June 15, 1964.[32] She then attended the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. from 1964 to 1968,[33] earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in drama, and studying under drama coach and master teacher, Father Gilbert V. Hartke.[34] During and shortly after college, she supported herself by cutting hair, cleaning houses and working as a switchboard operator.[35] In 1969, Sarandon went to a casting call for the motion-picture Joe (1970) with her then-husband Chris Sarandon. Although he did not get a part, she was cast in a major role of a disaffected teen who disappears into the seedy underworld. Between 1970 and 1972, she appeared in the soap operas A World Apart and Search for Tomorrow, playing Patrice Kahlman and Sarah Fairbanks, respectively.[26] She appeared in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) and also played the female lead in The Great Waldo Pepper (also 1975), opposite Robert Redford. She was twice directed by Louis Malle, in Pretty Baby (1978) and Atlantic City (1981). The latter earned Sarandon her first Academy Award nomination.[36] Her most controversial film appearance was in Tony Scott's The Hunger (1983), a modern vampire story in which she had a lesbian sex scene with Catherine Deneuve.[37] She appeared in the comedy-fantasy The Witches of Eastwick (1987) alongside Jack Nicholson, Cher, and Michelle Pfeiffer. However, Sarandon did not become a "household name" until she appeared with Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins in the film Bull Durham (1988), a commercial and critical success.[38] Roger Ebert praised Sarandon's performance in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times: "I don't know who else they could have hired to play Annie Savoy, the Sarandon character who pledges her heart and her body to one player a season, but I doubt if the character would have worked without Sarandon's wonderful performance".[39] Sarandon was nominated for an Academy Award four more times in the 1990s, as Best Actress in Thelma & Louise (1991), Lorenzo's Oil (1992), and The Client (1994), finally winning in 1995 for Dead Man Walking in which she played Sister Helen Prejean who regularly visits a convicted murderer on death row. Janet Maslin, in The New York Times, wrote of her performance in the last film: "Ms. Sarandon takes the kind of risk she took playing a stubbornly obsessed mother in Lorenzo's Oil. She's commandingly blunt, and she avoids cheapening her performance with the wrong kind of compassion. Her Sister Helen is repelled and alarmed by this man, but she's determined to help him anyway. That's what makes the film so unrelenting."[40] Sarandon was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award in 1994.[41] Additionally, she has received eight Golden Globe nominations, including for White Palace (1990), Stepmom (1998), Igby Goes Down (2002), and Bernard and Doris (2007).[42] Her other movies include Little Women (1994), Anywhere but Here (1999), Cradle Will Rock (1999), The Banger Sisters (2002), Shall We Dance (2004), Alfie (2004), Romance & Cigarettes (2005), Elizabethtown (2005), and Enchanted (2007).

"I wouldn't say the White House has taken me under its wing and made me one of its best buddies," Sarandon said.[74] In the 2016 United States presidential election, she made public her support for Senator Bernie Sanders.[75][76] On March 28, 2016, in an interview on All In with Chris Hayes, Sarandon indicated that she and other Sanders supporters might not support Hillary Clinton if Clinton is the Democratic nominee for president. She stated: "You know, some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately. If he gets in, then things will really explode." Hayes inquired as to whether it would be dangerous to allow Trump to become president, to which she replied: "If you think that it's pragmatic to shore up the status quo right now, then you're not in touch with the status quo".[77] On October 30, 2016, she endorsed Green Party of the United States presidential candidate Jill Stein.[78] In an interview with The Guardian published on November 26, 2017, Sarandon said about Hillary Clinton: "I did think she was very, very dangerous.
