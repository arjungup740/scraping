He was one of his few friends."[42] He played the lead role in the crime film Criminal (2004), with Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Based on the Argentine film Nine Queens (2000), Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt that "John C. Reilly may be one of our finer character actors, but his portrayal of Richard Gaddis, a gimlet-eyed con man, in Criminal allows too many vestiges of the duped schlub of a husband he played in Chicago to leak into his performance."[43] Reilly reportedly quit the 2005 Lars von Trier film Manderlay to protest the on-set killing of a donkey.[44] He played the lead in one of Miranda July's short films, Are You the Favorite Person of Anybody? (2005).[45] He was in the Jennifer Connelly-led horror film Dark Water (2005) as the manager of a mysterious hotel.[46] Reilly co-starred in Adam McKay's comedy about NASCAR drivers entitled Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby in August 2006 as Cal Naughton Jr., the best friend and teammate of the title character, played by Will Ferrell.[16] The film was successful, grossing $163 million worldwide.[47] He appeared in Robert Altman's last film A Prairie Home Companion that same year,[48] in addition to making an uncredited cameo appearance in Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny as a Sasquatch.[49] Reilly frequently appeared on the sketch comedy program Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! from 2007 to 2010 as inept doctor and television presenter Dr. Steve Brule.

It also starred Oscar-winners Jodie Foster as his wife, and Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz as another married couple who engage in a conflict after their children get into a fight.[66] Reilly was approached to appear in a production of the play it was based on, God of Carnage, but he couldn't fit it into his schedule and remarked "I think I've spent enough time in that apartment".[67] Reilly voiced the title character in the 2012 animated film Wreck-It Ralph,[68] which follows an arcade game villain who is determined to prove himself as the hero. Reilly made contributions to the film's script.[69] The film was positively received,[70] with Los Angeles Times writer Betsy Sharkey saying, "The movie's subversive sensibility and old-school/new-school feel are a total kick."[71] Wreck-It Ralph grossed over $471 million and a sequel titled Ralph Breaks the Internet was released in November 2018.[72][73][74] Also that year, Reilly appeared in Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie as the dim-witted Taquito and made an uncredited cameo appearance in the comedy The Dictator, starring Sacha Baron Cohen.[75][76] He had a cameo in the 2013 comedy sequel Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, playing the ghost of Confederate General Stonewall Jackson in the film's fight scene.[77] In 2014, Reilly narrated the nature documentary Bears.[78] He played Nova Corps corpsman Rhomann Dey in the Marvel Studios film Guardians of the Galaxy, released in August 2014.[79] Reilly began co-starring in the animated television series Stone Quackers on FXX in January 2015.[80] In addition to voicing the inept police officer Barry, Reilly also executive produced the series.[80][81] 2015 saw him appear in five films: the drama Entertainment;[82] Yorgos Lanthimos' comedy-drama The Lobster as Robert, a man with a lisp who is given 45 days to find a romantic partner or otherwise be turned into an animal;[83] the fantasy horror Tale of Tales, in which he played a king who tries to conceive a child with his queen–played by Salma Hayek–through an unconventional method,[84] and the English dub of the Studio Ghibli animated film When Marnie Was There.[85] Reilly also starred in and co-wrote the television special Bagboy, reprising his role as Dr. Steve Brule in a fictional television pilot for a sitcom created by Brule.[86] It aired on February 21, 2015, with Vanity Fair writer Melissa Locker saying "If you get it, the show is knockout hilarious, but truthfully, it is not for everyone and Reilly is O.K. with that."[87] Reilly voiced a sheep in the ensemble cast of the computer-animated musical comedy Sing, which was released in December 2016.[88] Reilly appeared in the 2017 monster film reboot Kong: Skull Island, as Hank Marlow, a World War II lieutenant who has spent 28 years stranded on the titular island.[89][90] The actor, who described his character as "essentially a love-letter to Chicago", was singled out for praise for his performance out of what is generally considered to be an underwhelming ensemble cast.[91] Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz noted that Reilly "steals the film instantly and never gives it back" in playing the "wisecracking castaway", and Owen Gleiberman praised his performance for being "terrifically dry and sly" in what could have been a cliché character.[92][93] Reilly co-starred with Steve Coogan in the 2018 biopic Stan & Ollie about the comic double act Laurel and Hardy, with Reilly portraying Oliver Hardy and Coogan Stan Laurel.[94] Also that year, he played hitman Eli Sisters in The Sisters Brothers, based on the Patrick deWitt Western novel, with Joaquin Phoenix co-starring as his brother Charlie, Jacques Audiard directing, and Reilly as a producer.[95] Reilly himself optioned the rights in 2011,[96] and production took place in the summer of 2017.[97] In 2018, Reilly played Dr. Watson in a comedic adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes & Watson; Will Ferrell played Holmes.[98] In the same year, Reilly reprised his role as Wreck-It Ralph in Ralph Breaks the Internet.
