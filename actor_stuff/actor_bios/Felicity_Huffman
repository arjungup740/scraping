In no case is that truer than with Huffman's Barb, who is the morally questionable center of the story. Barb is a Lifetime movie heroine: a tough, divorced mother who raised her children alone, and is fighting now to bring her son's murderer to justice. Except this isn't that kind of show, and Barb's battles have not just made her stronger; they've made her hate all the people she's felt she had to fight. Which is why Huffman's gut-wrenching performance is so startling. A bundle of barely concealed fury, Huffman forces us to invest in a woman who thinks her bigotry makes her not just right, but noble."[45] In 2018, Huffman starred in the second season of the Epix comedy-drama Get Shorty.[46] In 2019, Huffman starred in two Netflix projects: the Ava DuVernay miniseries When They See Us about the famous Central Park jogger case from 1989 in which a jogger was attacked in Central Park in New York City[47] and in the comedy-drama film Otherhood based on the novel Whatever Makes You Happy by William Sutcliffe,[47] She also starred in the drama film Tammy's Always Dying directed by Amy Jo Johnson.[48] which had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2019.[49] Huffman dated actor William H.
