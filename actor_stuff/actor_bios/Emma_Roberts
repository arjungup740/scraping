Through her mother's marriage, she is the stepdaughter of musician Kelly Nickels. She has a younger maternal half-sister, Grace.[5] Her paternal grandmother was acting coach Betty Lou Bredemus, and her aunts are actresses Julia Roberts and Lisa Roberts Gillan. During her childhood, Roberts spent time on the sets of her aunt Julia's films. These experiences sparked a desire to follow her father and aunts into the film industry.[5] Her mother initially wanted her to have a normal childhood.[6] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent through her father.[7][8] 
Roberts made her acting debut at age nine in Ted Demme's 2001 drama film Blow. It was the first film for which she auditioned.[6] In the film, she portrayed Kristina Jung, the daughter of Johnny Depp's character (cocaine smuggler George Jung). That year, she also had a role in Leif Tilden's 10-minute short bigLove, and was an uncredited extra in some scenes featuring her aunt Julia Roberts in America's Sweethearts.[9] Roberts went on to appear in smaller roles in two family films: in 2002's Grand Champion, as the sister of the main character Buddy (Jacob Fisher); and in 2006's Spymate, as the kidnapped daughter of former secret agent Mike Muggins (Chris Potter), who tries to rescue her with the help of a spy monkey. Grand Champion had a brief theatrical release in August 2004,[10] while Spymate was not released until February 2006, when it was given a theatrical run in Canada,[11] followed by its DVD release in April 2006. In 2004, she began starring as the lead character Addie Singer in the Nickelodeon sitcom Unfabulous,[12] which debuted in September of that year. The sitcom earned Roberts several Teen Choice Award and Young Artist Award nominations.[13] The series focused on a seventh grader, Addie, and her two best friends. It aired for three seasons (2004–2007). The show also spawned TV movies, including The Perfect Moment. Also in 2004, Roberts guest starred in an episode of the Nickelodeon series Drake & Josh titled "Honor Council". After her run on Unfabulous, Nickelodeon had considered giving Roberts a kick start into a music career.[14] In 2005, Roberts released a debut album titled Unfabulous and More. The album was released on September 27, 2005, through Columbia Records and Nick Records. It also served as the soundtrack to the television series Unfabulous, in which Roberts starred. The album peaked at number 46 and 10 on Billboard's Heatseekers Albums and Kid Albums charts, respectively.[15] In September 2005, two singles were released from the album: "I Wanna Be" and "Dummy". The album includes several original songs (among them "Dummy" and "I Wanna Be", both of which were also released as music videos, "I Have Arrived" and "This Is Me", which was co-written by Roberts), as well as some of Addie's songs from the first season, including "Punch Rocker" and "New Shoes" (both from the episode "The Party"), "94 Weeks (Metal Mouth Freak)" (from "The Bar Mitzvah") and "Mexican Wrestler" (which had previously appeared on Jill Sobule's 2000 album Pink Pearl and in the episode "The 66th Day" from Unfabulous). In the same year, Roberts recorded "If I Had It My Way" for the soundtrack of the 2005 Disney film Ice Princess.

I am getting ready to start a new movie this summer so that is taking a lot of my time. I think when I am a little bit older it is definitely something I'd like to pursue."[25] In another interview, she said: "My musical career is indefinitely on hold. I don't like people who become like 'actor slash singer.' I think people should be one or the other because usually you're not going to be great at both. You're going to be better at one, so you might as well stick to the one you're good at. I'm going for acting."[26] In 2008, Roberts starred as the lead in the film Wild Child,[27] about a rebellious teen from Malibu, California sent to a boarding school in England. Roberts described her character as "pretty much your typical spoiled-brat Malibu socialite who gets shipped off to a British boarding school."[28] Roberts also appeared in two films: Lymelife, which was premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and The Flight Before Christmas, where she had her voiceover debut when she voiced the English version of the character Wilma.[29] In 2009, Roberts starred alongside Jake T.

Tom Shone of The Guardian and Ian Freer of Empire both called her the "standout" of the film,[45] with Freer praising her performance for being "heartbreaking as she suggests longings and anxieties without over-hyping it. Much like the film itself."[46] Robert next appeared in season three of the FX anthology horror series American Horror Story, called American Horror Story: Coven, in a main role from late 2013 through January 2014.
