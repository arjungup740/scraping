In the series, a mockumentary about life at a mid-sized paper supply company, he played the role of Jim Halpert, an intelligent and mild-mannered sales representative and, in later seasons, co-manager of the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin in Scranton, Pennsylvania.[22] Krasinski and Jenna Fischer's characters also served as the central love interests of the series.[23]
To prepare for his role, Krasinski visited Scranton for research and interviewed employees at actual paper companies. He also shot the footage of Scranton used in the opening credits.[24] He appeared in every episode of the series and also directed several including "Sabre".

MTV.com praised his acting, describing him as "an actor who's able to project both boyish warmth and intellectual concern" while also stating that he "manages the considerable feat of holding the screen opposite Clooney without melting in the heat of his trademark movie-star mega-wattage."[30] In 2009, Krasinski made his directorial debut in the comedy-drama film Brief Interviews with Hideous Men. He wrote the screenplay for the film based on David Foster Wallace's collection of short stories, played a minor role in it and also served as producer. The film premiered on January 19, 2009 at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize[31] and received mostly positive reviews.[32] Film critic A.O. Scott wrote that "though this experiment doesn't quite succeed, there's enough intelligence and insight in this movie to make it worth the attempt" while Elizabeth Weitzman from New York Daily News felt that "Krasinski deserves credit for having the ambition to adapt material as difficult as David Foster Wallace's short stories."[32] The same year, he starred in the comedy-drama Away We Go with Maya Rudolph, directed by Sam Mendes.[33] It follows a couple searching North America for the perfect community in which to settle down and start a family. The film received positive reviews from critics.
