Being an ordinary, unoriginal and unloved woman, she instead becomes so wrapped up in her own quiet neurosis that she finds herself physically stuck in a full body girdle. I wrote and directed Worst Enemy in 2010 as an experiment to see if I could take on being a filmmaker".[35] Bell made her writing and directing feature film debut at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival with In a World....[2][1][36] which she wrote and directed and in which she starred[21] She describes the film as "a comedy about a female voice-over artist and family dysfunction and relationships.
