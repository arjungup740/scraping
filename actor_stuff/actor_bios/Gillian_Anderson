She was appointed an honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2016 for her services to drama. She has resided in London since 2002, after earlier years divided between the United Kingdom and the United States. Anderson was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Rosemary "Posie" Alyce (née Lane),[2][3][4] a computer analyst, and later vice president of Neurofibromatosis Inc., the NF support group of West Michigan, and Homer Edward "Ed" Anderson III, who owned a film post-production company.[5][6] She is of English, German, and Irish ancestry.[7] Soon after her birth, her parents moved to Puerto Rico for 15 months, then to London. The family relocated so that her father could attend the London Film School.[8] During her childhood, she lived in north London's Crouch End and Haringey.[9] She was a pupil of Coleridge Primary School.[10] When Anderson was 11 years old, her family returned to the United States, settling in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[11] They continued to keep a flat in London and spent their summers there.[12] Anderson later said that she had always intended to return to England.[13] In Grand Rapids, she attended Fountain Elementary and City High-Middle School, a program for gifted students with a strong emphasis on the humanities.[14] We were in a small Republican town. There were only six punks there. We were weird. It's not like London. —Anderson on her teenage years in Grand Rapids[15] Following the move to Grand Rapids, Anderson went through a rebellious stage as a teenager; taking drugs, dating a much older boyfriend, and cultivating a punk appearance (dyeing her hair various colors, shaving the sides of her head, sporting a nose piercing and an all-black wardrobe).[12][14][16] She was put in therapy at the age of 14.[15] Anderson listened to bands such as Dead Kennedys and Skinny Puppy. She was voted by her classmates as "class clown", "most bizarre girl" and "most likely to be arrested". She was arrested on graduation night for breaking and entering into her high school in an attempt to glue the locks of the doors.[17] She later managed to reduce the charges to trespassing.[18] At an early age, Anderson was interested in marine biology, but after becoming interested in theatre during her teenage years, she began acting in high school productions during her first year and later in community theatre.[14] She also served as a student intern at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre & School of Theatre Arts.[19] After graduating from high school in 1986, she attended The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1990.[20] Anderson also participated in the National Theatre of Great Britain's summer program at Cornell University.[14] To support herself financially during her student years, she worked at the Goose Island Brewpub in Chicago. After Anderson became famous, the brewery named one of their beers after her – a Belgian-style farmhouse ale called "Gillian".[13] Anderson is the eldest of three siblings. Her brother Aaron – who was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis – died in 2011 of a brain tumor, at the age of 30. Aaron was a DJ, a mentor, and a practicing Buddhist. He was in his second year of a PhD program in developmental psychology at Stanford University when he was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2008.[21][22] Her sister Zoe is a ceramicist, whom Anderson called "an exceptional artist".[23] 
Anderson is bidialectal and is comfortable switching between American and British (Received Pronunciation) accents.[24]  With her English accent and background, she was mocked and felt out of place as a teenager in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwestern accent. To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents.[25][26] In May 2013, during an interview with BlogTalkRadio, Anderson addressed the matter of her national identity: "I've been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don't know what the answer to that question is. I know that I feel that London is home and I'm very happy with that as my home. I love London as a city and I feel very comfortable there. In terms of identity, I'm still a bit baffled."[27] Anderson moved to New York when she was 22 years old, and worked as a waitress to support herself.[28] She began her career in Alan Ayckbourn's play Absent Friends at the Manhattan Theatre Club alongside Brenda Blethyn;[29] for her role she won the 1990–91 Theatre World Award for "Best Newcomer".[30] Her next theatrical role was in Christopher Hampton's The Philanthropist at the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut.[31] Anderson moved to Los Angeles in 1992 and spent a year auditioning. The same year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, The Turning, starring Karen Allen and Tess Harper. The film drama is an adaptation of the play Home Fires Burning.[28] 
Although she had once vowed she would never do television work, being out of work for a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: "First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [to auditions] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't want to be involved in it."[28] She broke into mainstream television in 1993 with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, Class of '96, on the fledgling Fox Network.[8] As a result of this guest appearance, Anderson was sent the script for The X-Files. She was 24 when she decided to audition because, "for the first time in a long time, the script involved a strong, independent, intelligent woman as a lead character."[32] Producer Chris Carter wanted to hire her, but Fox wanted someone with previous television exposure and greater sex appeal.[28] Fox sent in more actresses, but Carter stood by Anderson, and she was eventually cast as FBI Special Agent Dana Scully. Filmed for the first five seasons in Vancouver, British Columbia, before moving to Los Angeles, the series ran for nine seasons. Two related films were also produced, released in 1998 and 2008. During her time on The X-Files, Anderson won numerous awards for her portrayal of Special Agent Scully, including an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series,[33] a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Series Drama, two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series and a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television. Anderson is the first actress to win an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a SAG Award in the same year.[34] For the role, she received a total of four Emmy nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and nine SAG nominations.[14] We got a lot of letters all the time, and I was told quite frequently by girls who were going into the medical world or the science world or the FBI world or other worlds that I reigned, that they were pursuing those pursuits because of the character of Scully. And I said, 'Yay!' —Anderson on "The Scully Effect"[35] Anderson was the first woman to write and direct an episode of The X-Files ("all things"). During its run – between the fifth and sixth seasons – Anderson co-starred in The X-Files: Fight the Future, a 1998 film that continued The X-Files storyline. Anderson also provided the voice for a parody of her Scully character in "The Springfield Files", an episode of the animated comedy television series The Simpsons. While filming The X-Files, she met assistant art director Clyde Klotz, who became her first husband.[14] Anderson's character on The X-Files initiated a phenomenon referred to as "The Scully Effect"; as the medical doctor and the FBI Special Agent inspired many young women to pursue careers in science, medicine, and law enforcement. It contributed to the increase in the number of women in those fields.[36][37] "The Scully Effect" remains a subject of academic inquiry.[38] In 1996, Anderson narrated the television documentaries Spies Above and Why Planes Go Down.
