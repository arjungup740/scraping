He attended John Burroughs School, a private school in Ladue, where he was a member of the football, baseball, and swim teams.[16] During this time, he dated Sarah Clarke, who became an actress.[17] When Hamm was 20, his father died.

The incident resulted in the fraternity being shut down on campus. The pledge ended up needing medical care, and ultimately withdrew from school.[19] Hamm made a plea deal and completed probation under the terms of a deferred adjudication, allowing him to not actually be convicted of a crime.[19][22] The charges were dismissed in August 1995 following the completion of his probation.[19][22] After graduating in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English,[22] Hamm returned to his high school to teach eighth-grade acting.[10][16][23] One of his students was Ellie Kemper, who became an actress. Years later, Hamm appeared in Kemper's Netflix series, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.[24] I came in the Dawson's Creek era; it was all about tiny guys who looked like teenagers, and I haven't looked like a teenager ever. So I was, like, auditioning to be their dads. At 25.  Not wishing to stay in a "normal career," Hamm relocated to Los Angeles permanently during 1995[26].[17] He moved into a house with four other aspiring actors and began working as a waiter while attending auditions.[16] He acted in theater, including as Flavius in a production of Shakespeare's Timon of Athens with the Sacred Fools Theater Company.[27] Looking older than his age, he found it difficult to find work as an actor, despite representation by the William Morris Agency. [17][25][26][28] During 1998, having failed to obtain any acting jobs after three years, he was terminated as a client by William Morris.[9] 
Hamm continued working as a waiter[16] and, briefly, as a set designer for a softcore pornography movie.[25] After repeatedly failing to get promising roles, Hamm set his 30th birthday as a deadline to succeed in Hollywood,[15] stating: You either suck that up and find another agent, or you go home and say you gave it a shot, but that's the end of that. The last thing I wanted to be out here was one of those actors who's 45 years old, with a tenuous grasp of their own reality, and not really working much. So I gave myself five years. I said, if I can't get it going by the time I'm 30, I'm in the wrong place. And as soon as I said that, it's like I started working right away.[16] During 2000, Hamm landed the role of romantic firefighter Burt Ridley on NBC's drama series Providence.[29][30] His one-episode contract grew to 19,[10][14] and allowed him to quit waiting tables.[17][28] Hamm made his feature movie debut with one line in Clint Eastwood's space adventure Space Cowboys (2000);[29][31] more substantial roles followed in the independent comedy movie Kissing Jessica Stein (2001)[32] and the war film We Were Soldiers (2002).[29][33] During filming of that movie, he turned 30.[15] Hamm's career was bolstered by his playing the recurring role of police inspector Nate Basso on Lifetime's television series The Division, from 2002 to 2004.[29][30] Other minor roles followed on the television series What About Brian, CSI: Miami, Related, Numb3rs, The Unit, and The Sarah Silverman Program.[29][30] Hamm's Mad Men castmate Eric Ladin said in an interview that he admired Hamm because he was persistent until he became successful as an actor.[34] Hamm landed his breakthrough role during 2007, when he was cast from more than 80 candidates[25] as the protagonist character Don Draper, in AMC's drama series Mad Men. In the series, set in a fictional 1960s Madison Avenue (“Mad”) advertising agency, he plays a suave, married advertising executive with an obscure past.[35] He recalled, "I read the script for Mad Men and I loved it... I never thought they'd cast me — I mean, I thought they'd go with one of the five guys who look like me but are movie stars".[36] He believes that an actor with a "proven track record" would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show.[26] He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part.[16] Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, "it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part".
