His other film roles include Traffic, Mona Lisa Smile, Valentine's Day, Take Me Home Tonight, The Big Wedding, War Machine, Breakthrough, and Irresistible. He currently stars as Tom Hayworth in the comedy series Home Economics. Grace was born in New York City,[2][3] the son of Pat, an assistant to the schoolmaster of the New Canaan Country School, and John Grace, a Madison Avenue executive.[4][5] He has a sister, Jenny.[6] His paternal grandmother was from a German Jewish family, and his mother is of Irish descent.[7][8] Grace grew up in Darien, Connecticut, where actress Kate Bosworth was a middle-school friend, and actress Chloë Sevigny—who later appeared with him in high school stage plays—was sometimes his babysitter.[6] Grace was cast as Eric Forman on Fox's That '70s Show, which debuted in 1998. He played the role until the show's 8th and final season. His character was written out and replaced with a new character named Randy Pearson (Josh Meyers). Grace made a brief guest appearance in the final episode.[9][10] Grace played a prep school student who used marijuana and introduced his girlfriend to freebasing in director Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film Traffic, as well as having uncredited cameos as himself in Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven and its 2004 sequel, Ocean's Twelve. "The joke is that you're supposed to play the worst version of yourself and I don't think too many people are comfortable with that. I never thought for a second that people were really going to think that's what I was like. I think that people will know that I was faking it in those movies", he told Flaunt magazine in 2007.[citation needed] He planned to cameo in Ocean's Thirteen. However, due to his role in Spider-Man 3, he had to abandon these plans. As Grace said, "I was doing reshoots on Spider-Man 3. I was bummed. I actually talked to Steven Soderbergh about that and we had a thing and then I couldn't do it."[11] He appeared in director Mike Newell's 2003 film Mona Lisa Smile.[12] In 2004, Grace played the leading roles in Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! and In Good Company. That same year, he starred in P.S., which received only a limited theatrical release. Grace won the National Board of Review's 2004 award for Breakthrough Performance Actor for his work in In Good Company and P.S.[5] On January 15, 2005, Grace hosted Saturday Night Live.[5][13] In 2007, Grace portrayed Eddie Brock/Venom in Spider-Man 3, directed by Sam Raimi. Grace himself was a fan of the comics and read the Venom stories as a child.[14] In 2009, Grace became the subject of a recurring column on the entertainment/pop culture site Videogum, entitled "What's Up With Topher Grace?"[15] In 2010, Grace appeared in the ensemble comedy Valentine's Day and played the character of Edwin in Predators.[16] In 2011, Grace appeared in the 1980s retro comedy Take Me Home Tonight.[17] He co-wrote the script and co-produced the film.

In 2020, Grace was cast in ABC's Home Economics pilot.[28] Grace has long held an interest in making his own edits of popular films, particularly those involving Star Wars. He has stated that this has become a source of relaxation for him. His edits were shared on his now-defunct pop-culture website Cereal Prize. In 2012, he edited the Star Wars prequel trilogy into one 85-minute film,[29] titled Star Wars: Episode III.5: The Editor Strikes Back[30] and showed it to select audiences. The edit utilized original footage, music from the Clone Wars series, and a portion from Anthony Daniels' audiobook recordings. In 2014, he created a cut of Boogie Nights that served as a reconstruction of the character Brock Landers' fake movie "Angels Live in My Town".[31] In 2018, he created his own edit of The Hobbit, stating that “I think that maybe The Hobbit should’ve been one movie, and many people would agree. Money drives a lot of those franchises. It's better when the art leads”.[32] He specifically edited this as a way to relax while portraying David Duke in Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman. In 2019, Grace and editor Jeff Yorkes started a Twitter account for "Lou's Cafe", the pseudonym by which the two credit their work. The name comes from the diner featured in the film Back to the Future. Later that year, he and Yorkes were commissioned by Pixar to edit a retrospective for Toy Story 4, which was titled "Toy Story 4 Ever" and released on Pixar's YouTube account.
