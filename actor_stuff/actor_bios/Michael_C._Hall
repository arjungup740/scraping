 Michael Carlyle Hall (born February 1, 1971[1]) is an American actor and musician. He is known for playing the titular character in the Showtime series Dexter and David Fisher in the HBO drama series Six Feet Under, which collectively earned Hall a Golden Globe Award and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.[2] He has also acted in Broadway shows and narrated audiobooks. He is currently the lead vocalist in the band Princess Goes to the Butterfly Museum. Born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina, Hall graduated from New York University's graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1996. He began his acting career on Broadway in the revival of Cabaret and appeared in a variety of shows in the mid- to late 1990s. Aside from his acclaimed roles on Six Feet Under and Dexter, he starred in the Broadway musical Hedwig and The Angry Inch from 2014 to 2015, and led the 2019 Netflix thriller film In the Shadow of the Moon. In 2021, he returned to play the role of Dexter Morgan for a miniseries revival Dexter: New Blood. Hall was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. His mother, Janice (née Styons) Hall, is a mental health counselor at Lees-McRae College, and his father, William Carlyle Hall, a systems engineer manager for IBM.[3] Hall grew up an only child; his sister died in infancy before his birth. His father died of prostate cancer in 1982 at the age of 39 when Hall was 11 years old. He has said of this: "There was a very one-on-one, immediate family relationship, my mom and I."[4] In a 2004 interview, Hall spoke about his experience in the wake of his father's death: "Certainly, for a young boy, there's no good age, but I think I was on the cusp of a time in my life where I was starting to reach puberty, to relate to my father. To have him ... something gets frozen. As you revisit it for the rest of your life, it's sort of this slow—but hopefully sure—crawling out of that frozen moment."[5] Hall graduated from Ravenscroft School in Raleigh in 1989,[6] and from Earlham College, a liberal arts college in Richmond, Indiana, in 1993. While he has said that he had planned to become a lawyer, he later acknowledged that he had never formed a serious intent to go to law school.[7] Hall graduated from New York University's graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1996.[8] Hall discovered acting early in life: he performed in What Love Is when he was in second grade at Ravenscroft School. In fifth grade, he began singing, first in a boy's choir, and later, in high school, in musicals, performing in standards such as The Sound of Music, Oklahoma!, and Fiddler on the Roof. While a student at Earlham College, he continued acting, starring in Cabaret and other productions. Hall's professional acting career began in the theater. Off-Broadway, he appeared in Macbeth and Cymbeline at the New York Shakespeare Festival; in Timon of Athens and Henry V at The Public Theater; The English Teachers at the Manhattan Class Company (MCC); and the controversial play Corpus Christi at the Manhattan Theatre Club. He also performed the role of Paris Singer in the workshop production of a Sondheim musical (titled Wise Guys at the time, and in later versions, Bounce and then Road Show. His character's songs and function were transferred to the character Hollis Bessamer in the final version.) In Los Angeles, Hall appeared in Skylight at the Mark Taper Forum. As part of the Texas Shakespeare Festival in the summer of 1995, he played Lancelot in Camelot,[9] Lysander in A Midsummer Night's Dream,[9] and Claudio in Much Ado About Nothing.[9] In 1998, Hall performed in William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, in the role of Posthumus, which ran from August 4 to 30. In 1999, director Sam Mendes cast Hall as the flamboyant Emcee in the revival of Cabaret; this was Hall's first Broadway role. Mendes suggested Hall for the role of closeted David Fisher, when Alan Ball began casting the TV drama Six Feet Under. "Everything opened up for me in Cabaret," but, Hall reported in a 2004 interview, "It slammed shut for David."[5] Hall's work in the first season of Six Feet Under was recognized with a nomination for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series[10] and for an AFI Award nomination for Actor of the Year in 2002. In addition, he shared in the Screen Actors Guild nominations for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series all five years that the show was in production, winning the award in 2003 and 2004.[11] In 2003, Hall toured as Billy Flynn in the musical Chicago. In 2005, he returned to off-Broadway theater in the premiere of Noah Haidle's Mr. Marmalade, playing the title character, an emotionally disturbed little girl's imaginary friend. Hall starred in and co-produced the Showtime television series Dexter, in which he played a psychopathic blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department, who moonlights as a serial killer/vigilante.[12] Jennifer Carpenter played his adoptive sister, Debra Morgan. The series premiered on October 1, 2006, and ended its run in 2013. After months of rumors, on April 18, 2013, Showtime announced via social media that season eight would be Dexter's final season.[13]  Hall also voiced Dexter Morgan in the animated web series Dexter: Early Cuts. For his work on Dexter, Hall was nominated for five Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series from 2008 to 2012. The show itself was also nominated for Emmy citations in the Drama Series category in the same years.[14] He won the 2007 Television Critics Association award for Individual Achievement in Drama.[15] Hall was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Drama in 2007, 2008,[16] and again in 2010.[17] Also in 2010, he won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series. Hall stated he would be open to returning for a spinoff series, but said: "I can't even wrap my mind around that. And it's all just theoretical until there is some sort of script reflecting somebody's idea of where it could possibly go. But it's hard for me to imagine what that would be. Yeah, as far as playing Dexter again for an undefined amount of time, that's a little daunting to consider. But doing another television series—there's a lot of amazing stuff on TV. I don't want to do that right away. But I wouldn't say never to that."[18] He has said he would consider revisiting his role as the serial killer if something was written that he deemed "worth pursuing".[19] Hall's film credits include the thriller Paycheck (2003), the science fiction thriller Gamer (2009), the 2011 drama The Trouble with Bliss (2011), the comedy Peep World (2012), and Kill Your Darlings (2013).[20] Hall performed in a film adaptation of Joe R.

At the end of 2015 and the start of 2016, Hall starred as Thomas Newton in the NYTW stage production of Lazarus, created by David Bowie and Enda Walsh.[24] Hall performed the song "Lazarus", which appeared on Bowie's final album, Blackstar (2016), on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in December 2015.[25] He later appeared in the London production from October 25, 2016, until January 22, 2017.

Hall wore a wig for season 5 of Dexter to cover up his hair loss due to chemotherapy.[48] On April 25, 2010, Carpenter announced that Hall's cancer was fully in remission[49] and he was set to get back to work for a new season of Dexter.[50] Hall is the face of the Somalia Aid Society's "Feed The People" campaign.
