The Associated Press reported: "During her 50 years as a widely known personality, Winters was rarely out of the news. Her stormy marriages, her romances with famous stars, her forays into politics and feminist causes kept her name before the public. She delighted in giving provocative interviews and seemed to have an opinion on everything." That led to a second career as a writer. Though not a conventional beauty, she claimed that her acting, wit, and "chutzpah" gave her a love life to rival Monroe's. Her alleged "conquests" included William Holden, Sean Connery, Burt Lancaster, Errol Flynn, and Marlon Brando.[29] Winters was married four times. Her husbands were: Hours before her death, Winters married long-time companion Gerry DeFord, with whom she had lived for 19 years. Though Winters's daughter objected to the marriage, the actress Sally Kirkland performed the wedding ceremony for the two at Winters's deathbed. Kirkland, a minister of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, also performed non-denominational last rites for Winters. Winters had a much-publicized romance with Farley Granger that became a long-term friendship (according to their respective autobiographies).[citation needed] She starred with him in the 1951 film Behave Yourself! as well as in a 1957 television production of A.

Joplin never did.[37] Winters died at the age of 85 on January 14, 2006, of heart failure at the Rehabilitation Center of Beverly Hills; she had suffered a heart attack on October 14, 2005.[1] She is interred at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.[38] Her third former husband, Anthony Franciosa, had a stroke on the same day she died, and he died five days later.
