Otherwise I could have done a lot of Hollywood movies. After Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon I got a lot of offers, but I turned them down because they were all victim roles—poor girls sold to America to be a wife or whatever. I know I have the ability to go deeper, to take on more original roles than that. That's why I really appreciated Geisha, because it allowed us to show the world what kind of actors we are and what kind of characters we can play—not just action, kick-ass parts.[82] Zhang obtained Hong Kong residency in 2007 through the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme for her contribution to the local film industry.[83] She is an admirer and collector of the works of the Chinese contemporary artist Shen Jingdong.[84] Politically, she is a member of the China Zhi Gong Party.[85] Zhang was engaged to Israeli American venture capitalist Aviv Nevo until the couple separated in 2010.[86][87] Zhang married Chinese rock musician Wang Feng in May 2015.[88] On 27 December 2015, Zhang gave birth to their daughter, Wang Xingxing.[89] In January 2020, Zhang gave birth to their son.[90][91] In 2005, Zhang was listed in TIME's World's 100 Most Influential People.
