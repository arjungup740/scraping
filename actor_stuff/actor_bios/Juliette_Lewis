Lewis made her first major screen appearance in the television film Home Fires (1987).[9] Howard Rosenberg of the Los Angeles Times praised Lewis's performance in the film, writing that she "lights up the screen."[9] She subsequently starred on the television  series I Married Dora, which ran between 1987 and 1988.[10] At age 14, she was legally emancipated from her parents (with their approval) in order to enable her to more freely work.[11] Lewis recalled her emancipation: "I know that sounds all radical, but when you start acting when you’re younger, you talk to other actor kids and their moms, and they’re like, 'Yeah, if you want to get a job, they like on your resume to say emancipated minor versus minor, because you then can work over eight hours.'"[11] For a brief period, Lewis lived with actress Karen Black, who was a mentor to her.[12] At age 15, Lewis dropped out of high school.[12] She subsequently had a minor part in the science fiction comedy My Stepmother Is an Alien (1988), before landing her first major supporting role as Audrey Griswold in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989).[13] She followed this with roles in the dystopian film Meet the Hollowheads,[14] and the comedy The Runnin' Kind (both 1989).[15] The same year, Lewis had a guest-starring role as Wayne's girlfriend, Delores, on the series The Wonder Years.[16] In 1990, Lewis co-starred with Brad Pitt in the Lifetime television film Too Young to Die?, a crime film loosely based on the case of Attina Marie Cannaday, playing a troubled young woman who falls into a world of prostitution and drugs.[17] During this period, Lewis herself was met with legal trouble after entering a bar at age 16, for which she was arrested and charged with underage drinking.[18] Lewis first garnered international attention and acclaim for her performance as Danielle Bowden, the daughter of a family targeted by psychopathic criminal Max Cady (Robert De Niro), in Martin Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear (1991), also starring Jessica Lange and Nick Nolte.[19] Vincent Canby of The New York Times lauded her performance, writing: "Though Danielle recognizes Max, she is willingly implicated in his scheme. It is one of Mr. De Niro's finest moments. It also reveals Miss Lewis to be a new young actress of stunning possibilities. The sequence is the heart of the movie."[19] Lewis garnered critical acclaim for her performance, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award,[20] as well as an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[21] Retrospectively, her character's seduction sequence was named one of the most unforgettable scenes in film history by Entertainment Weekly[22] and Complex.[23] In 1992, she had a supporting role as a college student in Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives,[24] followed by That Night, a coming-of-age drama set in the 1960s that marked the feature film debuts of Katherine Heigl and Eliza Dushku.[25] Lewis appeared in several films in 1993, including Peter Medak's neo-noir Romeo Is Bleeding, in which she played the mistress of a corrupt cop, played by Gary Oldman.[26] She then reunited with former co-star Brad Pitt in the thriller Kalifornia, in which she starred as a childlike woman whose boyfriend is a serial killer.[27] Critic Roger Ebert deemed Lewis's performance in the latter film one "of the most harrowing and convincing performances I've ever seen."[27] At the time of filming Kalifornia, Lewis and Pitt had been in a relationship since 1990, though they separated the year of the film's release.[28] She subsequently co-starred with Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio in the Lasse Hallström-directed drama What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), portraying a free-spirited woman who befriends a young man and his mentally disabled brother in a small Iowa town.[29] Lewis also appeared in the video for the Melissa Etheridge song “Come to My Window,” (1993), portraying a mental patient. Lewis then portrayed Mallory Knox, a murderous woman who embarks on a killing spree with her psychotic lover Mickey (Woody Harrelson), in Oliver Stone's controversial satirical crime film Natural Born Killers (1994).[30][31] Though the film was criticized for its graphic violence and inspiring of copycat crimes,[32] Lewis's performance was praised as "sensational" by critic Peter Travers,[33] and won her the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival.[34] The same year, she had a supporting role opposite Steve Martin in Nora Ephron's Christmas-themed comedy Mixed Nuts.[35] Lewis subsequently played a rock singer in Kathryn Bigelow's science fiction film Strange Days (1995), doing her own singing on covers of two songs written by PJ Harvey.[36] Though a major box-office failure, Strange Days went on to develop a cult following in subsequent years.[37] Lewis also reunited with her What's Eating Gilbert Grape co-star DiCaprio, appearing with him in a supporting role in the crime drama The Basketball Diaries (1995).[38] This same year, at age 22, Lewis entered drug rehabilitation, having been addicted to cocaine and prescription medication for several years, and completed the Narconon program within the Church of Scientology.[39][40] The following year, Lewis had a leading role in The Evening Star (1996), a flop sequel to Terms of Endearment (1983), opposite Shirley MacLaine and Bill Paxton.[41] She also appeared in Robert Rodriguez's action horror film From Dusk till Dawn (1996).

The film received largely unfavorable reviews,[44] though Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised it as "beautifully acted...  Carla is played by Ms. Lewis with enormous heart and sensitivity, and with body language so precise that you soon forget it is a performance."[45] In September 1999, Lewis married professional skateboarder Steve Berra.[46] In 2000, Lewis starred opposite Benicio del Toro in the thriller The Way of the Gun,[47] and was featured as a vocalist on the track "Bad Brother" by the band The Infidels, from The Crow: Salvation soundtrack album, released on April that year.[48] She then appeared in the crime film Picture Claire (2001), opposite Gina Gershon, followed by the independent lesbian-themed drama Gaudi Afternoon (2001), co-starring with Judy Davis and Lili Taylor.[49] The film received unfavorable reviews, with A.

You have to be ready to have a partnership. And sometimes you’re like, 'Whoa, this is too much. I only actually have enough steam to focus on my own thing.'"[28] Beginning in 2003, Lewis embarked on a musical career, forming the rock band Juliette and the Licks with former Hole drummer Patty Schemel.[56] The band released their debut EP, ...Like a Bolt of Lightning, in late 2004 through Fiddler Records.[57] She also appeared as a guest vocalist on three tracks by electronic music group The Prodigy's album Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned (also released in 2004).[58] The same year, Lewis appeared in the comedy film Starsky & Hutch, playing the role of Kitty, as Reese Feldman's girlfriend,[59] and had a supporting part in the Jan Kounen's French futuristic Western film Blueberry opposite Vincent Cassel.[60] She subsequently appeared in the Johnny Knoxville-led comedy Daltry Calhoun (2005), playing the girlfriend of a Tennessee entrepreneur,[61] and in the drama Aurora Borealis (also 2005), playing the live-in assistant of an elderly couple (played by Donald Sutherland and Louise Fletcher).[62] In May 2005, Juliette and the Licks released their debut studio album, You're Speaking My Language[63] The band toured internationally in support of the album, and received a favorable concert review from The Guardian's David Peschek, who wrote that Lewis is "exactly the kind of iconic presence that boringly boy-saturated rock needs. The Licks–they are very definitely a band, not just the star and some flunkies–are fantastic."[63] Lewis had a supporting part in the 2006-released The Darwin Awards, an independent comedy starring Winona Ryder and Joseph Fiennes,[64] followed by Catch and Release,[65] a romantic comedy that premiered at the Austin Film Festival in October 2006.

I think there's so much confusion because people don't understand a religion where you can be another religion but you can still practice Scientology. That's why it's completely progressive. It's just tools for living. It's about understanding one's self and others and compassion and how to communicate better and how to live in this troubled society. It's really basic, common sense stuff. It has nothing to do with all this funny folklore that surrounds it.[104] In December 2021, Lewis stated she no longer identified as a Scientologist.[105]
