Though Davis had only one scene in the film, she remained a highlight of the film with noted film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times specifically praising her performance writing, "It lasts about 10 minutes, but it is the emotional heart and soul of "Doubt," and if Viola Davis isn't nominated by the Academy, an injustice will have been done." Ebert would further go on to write, "She goes face to face with the pre-eminent film actress of this generation, and it is a confrontation of two equals that generates terrifying power."[42][43] She was nominated for several awards for her performance, including a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.[44] On June 30, 2009, Davis was inducted into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[45] In 2010, Davis returned to Broadway in her third August Wilson play, this time a revival of Fences as Rose Maxson, acting alongside Denzel Washington. Her performance received raves from critics in particular theatre critic Ben Brantley of The New York Times who described Davis' performance as "extraordinary", adding "Ms. Davis, who won a Tony for her performance in Wilson's “King Hedley II,” may well pick up another for her work here.

I channeled the spirit of my grandmother, and I've kind of paid homage to how they've contributed to my life and the lives of so many people".[49] She has since expressed deep regret over taking on the role; although she still admires the people she worked with, she does not think the story or portrayal is truthful about the lives of the black characters.[50] Davis garnered critical acclaim for her performance and eventually won two Screen Actors Guild Awards, in addition to receiving her second Academy Award nomination,[51] as well as Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award nominations.[52][53] In 2012, Time magazine listed Davis as one of the most influential people in the world.[54] Also in 2012, Glamour magazine named Davis Glamour's Film Actress of the year.[55] On June 12, 2012, Davis was presented with the Women in Film's Crystal Award by her friend and Oscar rival that year, Meryl Streep.[56] On June 25, 2012, the Walk of Fame Committee of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced that Davis was part of the new group of entertainment professionals who have been selected to receive stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013.[57] On January 5, 2017, Davis received the 2,597th star on the Walk of Fame.[58] In 2014, Davis reunited with The Help director Tate Taylor in Get on Up, a biopic of James Brown, playing Brown's mother.[59] Her 3-year-old daughter, Genesis also appeared in the movie.[60] In February 2014, Davis was cast in Peter Nowalk's pilot How to Get Away with Murder (executive produced by Shonda Rhimes for her ShondaLand production company) as the lead character.[61] Her character, Annalise Keating, is a tough criminal defense attorney and professor who becomes entangled in murder plot with her students.[62][63][64] It began as a series in September 2014.[65] In September 2015, Davis became the first African-American to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role on How to Get Away with Murder.[66][67][68][69] She received a second Primetime Emmy Award nomination for the role in 2016.[70] Davis also won two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series in 2014 and 2015.[71] She received nominations from the Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and Critics' Choice Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series for her performance on the show.[72] In 2015, Davis appeared in Blackhat, a Michael Mann-directed thriller film starring Chris Hemsworth.[73] Davis also served as executive-producer of the crime drama film Lila & Eve, starring herself and Jennifer Lopez in the titular roles.[74] In 2016, Davis starred in the courtroom drama Custody, on which she also served as an executive producer,[75] and played Amanda Waller in the film Suicide Squad, an adaptation of a DC Comics series of the same name.[76] In 2016, Davis reprised her role as Rose Maxson for the film adaptation of Fences directed by and starring Denzel Washington.
