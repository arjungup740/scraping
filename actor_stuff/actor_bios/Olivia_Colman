Sarah Caroline Colman was born in Norwich on 30 January 1974,[5][6] the daughter of nurse Mary (née Leakey) and chartered surveyor Keith Colman.[7][8] She was privately educated at Norwich High School for Girls and Gresham's School in Holt, Norfolk. Her first role was Jean Brodie in a school production of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie at the age of 16.[9] She cites her mother's interrupted career as a ballet dancer as an inspiration to pursue acting professionally.[10] Colman spent a term studying primary teaching at Homerton College, Cambridge before studying drama at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, from which she graduated in 1999.[11] During her time at Cambridge, she appeared in the Channel 4 series The Word in 1995, under her nickname "Colly",[12] auditioned for the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club and met future co-stars David Mitchell and Robert Webb.[13][11][14][15][2] Colman had to adopt a different stage name when she began working professionally, because Equity (the UK actors' union) already had an actress named "Sarah Colman". "One of my best friends at university was called Olivia and I always loved her name," Colman told The Independent in 2013. "I was never Sarah; I was always called by my nickname, Colly, so it didn't seem so awful not to be called Sarah."[2] Colman was a subject of the UK genealogy programme Who Do You Think You Are? in July 2018.[16] Although she expected that her family tree would mainly relate to Norfolk, it was discovered that her fourth great-grandfather, Richard Campbell Bazett, had been born on the island of Saint Helena[17] and that he worked in London for the East India Company. Bazett's son, Colman's third great-grandfather Charles Bazett, married Harriot Slessor. Researchers discovered that she was born in the Indian city of Kishanganj, lost her British father when she was aged three, and then made the journey to England alone.[16] Slessor's passage was paid for by her paternal grandmother.[18] The episode speculated that Slessor's mother might have been Indian, but did not present concrete proof; after the episode aired, the Berkshire Record Office published the will of Slessor's mother, which proved that her name was Seraphina Donclere, evidently of European origin, and that she had died in 1810.[19][20] Colman made her professional acting debut in 2000, at the age of 26, as part of the BBC2 comedy sketch show Bruiser. She has since appeared in roles in many BBC, ITV, and Channel 4 television series, such as People Like Us, Look Around You, Black Books, The Office, The Time of Your Life and provided the voice-over for Five's poll for Britain's Funniest Comedy Character. Colman regularly featured in BBC Radio 4 comedies, such as Concrete Cow, Think the Unthinkable, The House of Milton Jones and Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.

She provided voices for the Andrex "be kind to your behind" adverts and Glade fragrance adverts, where her character is a gorilla. On several projects, Colman has worked with the comedians Mitchell and Webb.[14] She joined them in 2003 to play the role of Sophie in the Channel 4 comedy Peep Show. Other joint ventures have included radio's That Mitchell and Webb Sound, and the television version That Mitchell and Webb Look. She decided to leave the programme after her agent suggested that she was becoming too closely associated with their work and needed to widen her horizons, a decision that was made "with tears".[22] She continued to appear on Peep Show, though less often, until it ended in 2015. Colman also had a recurring role in the surreal comedy Green Wing from 2004 to 2006.
