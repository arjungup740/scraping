The family lived in Coppell, Texas; Mesa, Arizona; and Highlands Ranch, Colorado, moving frequently due to her father's work. Russell's dancing earned her a spot on The Mickey Mouse Club.[4] Russell first appeared on television at age 15 as a cast member of the All-New Mickey Mouse Club variety show on the Disney Channel.[5] She was on the show from 1991 to 1994, encompassing seasons four to six. In 1992, Russell appeared in Honey, I Blew Up the Kid and in 1993, she had a role on the sitcom Boy Meets World as character Mr. Feeny's niece.

In 1999, she won a Golden Globe for the role. Russell's long, curly hair was one of her character's defining characteristics and her hairstyle change at the beginning of the show's second season was speculated by some to have caused a significant drop in the show's ratings.[7] During the show's run, Russell appeared in the films Eight Days a Week, The Curve and Mad About Mambo, all of which received only limited releases in North America. Her next role was in the film We Were Soldiers (2002),[4] playing the wife of a United States serviceman during the Vietnam War. The film was released two months before the end of Felicity's run. When Felicity ended, Russell moved to New York City and made her off-Broadway stage debut in 2004 in Neil LaBute's Fat Pig.[8] In 2005, she returned to television and film, beginning with an appearance in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie The Magic of Ordinary Days, theatrical film The Upside of Anger and the television miniseries Into the West.

She was screen tested for the role of Lois Lane in Superman Returns, but lost the role to Kate Bosworth.[9] In mid-2006, Russell was chosen to be a celebrity spokeswoman for CoverGirl cosmetics.[10] In the summer of 2007, Russell appeared in The Keri Kronicles, a reality show sitcom sponsored by CoverGirl and airing on MySpace; the show was filmed at Russell's home in Manhattan and spotlighted her life.[11] Also in 2007, she played Melody on the NBC show Scrubs. Russell next starred in the film Waitress, which marked the fourth time she played a pregnant woman.[12] Her performance was positively received by critics,[11] with Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun writing that Russell's performance had "aesthetic character" and "wields tenderness and fierceness with quiet heat".[13] In 2007, Russell also completed roles in Grimm Love (titled Rohtenburg for its German release), in which she played Katie Armstrong, a graduate student who writes her thesis on an infamous cannibal murder case and the thriller The Girl in the Park. Russell next appeared in August Rush, released in November 2007. She also appeared on the cover of the New York Post's Page Six magazine on November 11, 2007.[14] Russell later appeared in Bedtime Stories.[15] In an appearance on The View on December 15, 2008, Russell said she got the part because Adam Sandler's wife Jackie had seen her in Waitress and suggested her for the movie.
