Robbie Collin from the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph wrote of Collins: "She has an adorable, sensational, almost perfect face for cinema; think Audrey Hepburn with the eyebrows of Liam Gallagher. Her smile is the platonic ideal of cheeky."[24] Collins made her singing debut in the film, performing an English re-written cover of "I Believe (in Love)". Also in 2012, Collins portrayed Samantha in Stuck in Love, starring alongside Jennifer Connelly, Logan Lerman, and Greg Kinnear.[25] Collins was initially cast as the lead in the 2013 remake of Evil Dead, but dropped out due to a scheduling issue.[26][27] She played the title role as an earth-visiting alien in M83's music video Claudia Lewis, released in August 2013.[28] She then starred as Clary Fray in The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, a film adaptation of the first book in The New York Times best-selling The Mortal Instruments novels, written by Cassandra Clare.[29] The role earned her a Teen Choice Award nomination in 2014.[30] In October 2013, Collins appeared in the music video for "City of Angels" by Thirty Seconds to Mars.[31] In 2014, Collins starred as Rosie Dunne in the film adaptation of Love, Rosie, alongside Sam Claflin, written by Cecelia Ahern.[32] Love, Rosie, was negatively received, although her performance was praised, with Donald Clarke of The Irish Times describing her as "perfectly charming."[33] Collins had a leading role as aspiring actress Marla Mabrey, alongside Alden Ehrenreich, in the romantic comedy-drama Rules Don't Apply (2016), from filmmaker Warren Beatty, who also starred as billionaire Howard Hughes.[34] When the film was released in November, it received mixed reviews and only grossed $3.9 million against its $25 million budget.

So much so, she impressed me from the get-go with her emotionally rich performance."[51] In 2019, Collins co-starred with Zac Efron in the drama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile, directed by Joe Berlinger. She plays Elizabeth Kendall, Ted Bundy's long-time girlfriend, who struggles to accept that her boyfriend is a serial killer.
