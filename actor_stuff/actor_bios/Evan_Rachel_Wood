The effects can be catastrophic and promoting non fact based information is wholly irresponsible."[86] In February 2021, Wood named Manson as her alleged abuser on Instagram,[87] where four other women made similar allegations against him.[88] The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said they were investigating Manson due to allegations of domestic violence.[89] In the aftermath of the death of basketball player Kobe Bryant in January 2020, Wood was criticized for writing a message on Twitter hours after his death which said: "What happened is tragic. I am heartbroken for Kobe's family. He was a sports hero. He was also a rapist. And all of these truths can exist simultaneously."[90][91] This was in reference to Bryant having been charged with sexual assault in 2003. He pleaded not guilty.[92] The case was later dropped by prosecutors when the accuser did not want to testify in court. She sued Kobe in civil court, and the case was settled for an unknown amount.[93][94][95] Bryant's widow later said Wood's comment was "vile and disturbing", arguing: "Behavior like this is part of the reason why innocent black men go to jail for crimes they didn't commit. An accusation doesn't make someone guilty."[96] Puente, Maria (November 28, 2016). "Evan Rachel Wood posts Twitter letter about being raped twice". USA Today.
