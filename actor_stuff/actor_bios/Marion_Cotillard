The film was directed by Yann Samuel and was a box office hit in France. In 2004, she won the Chopard Trophy of Female Revelation at the Cannes Film Festival,[20] and appeared in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's A Very Long Engagement (Un Long Dimanche de Fiançailles), as the vengeful Tina Lombardi, for which she won a César Award for Best Supporting Actress,[21] and the mystery thriller Innocence, as Mademoiselle Éva;[2] both films were acclaimed by critics.

Her performance is as unexpected and as unsentimental and raw as the film itself".[54] She received a fifth César Award nomination, a fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, a third Golden Globe nomination (her first nomination for Best Actress – Drama), a second Critics' Choice Award nomination and a second Lumières Award nomination.[55] Cotillard also received several honours and career tributes in 2012, at the Telluride Film Festival,[56] Hollywood Film Festival,[57] AFI Fest,[58] Gotham Awards[59] and Harper's Bazaar Awards.[60] In 2013, Cotillard was named Woman of the Year by Hasty Pudding Theatricals,[61] a student society at Harvard, and was also ranked the 2nd highest paid actress in France in 2012.[62] In May 2013, she appeared in the controversial music video "The Next Day" by David Bowie, alongside Gary Oldman, her co-star in The Dark Knight Rises.[63] She had her first leading role in an American movie in James Gray's The Immigrant, starring as the Polish immigrant Ewa Cybulska, who wants to experience the American dream in 1920s New York, starring opposite Joaquin Phoenix and Jeremy Renner.

Variety's critic, Guy Lodge remarked: "Her deathless sleepwalking scene, staged in minimalist fashion under a gauze of snowflakes in a bare chapel, is played with tender, desolate exhaustion; it deserves to be viewed as near-definitive."[85] Cotillard was nominated for the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress for her performance.[86] In 2015, Cotillard starred in New York Philharmonic's production of Arthur Honegger's oratorio "Joan of Arc at the Stake",[87][88] and voiced the roles of The Rose in both the English and the French version of The Little Prince, directed by Mark Osborne,[89] Scarlet Overkill in the French version of Minions,[90] and that of April in the French-Canadian-Belgian 3D animated film April and the Extraordinary World (Avril et le Monde Truqué), directed by Franck Ekinci and Christian Demares.[91][92] In 2016, Cotillard played Gabrielle, a free-spirited woman in a convenience marriage, in Nicole Garcia's From the Land of the Moon (Mal de Pierres), an adaptation of the bestselling Italian novel Mal di Pietre by Milena Agus, which marked her return to French cinema after 2012's Rust and Bone,[93] and earned her a seventh César Award nomination.[94] She also obtained the part of Catherine, the sister-in-law of a 34-year-old gay playwright, in Xavier Dolan's It's Only the End of the World (Juste la fin du Monde).[95] Both films premiered in the main competition section of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, to polarized reactions from critics.[96][97] Cotillard starred opposite Brad Pitt in Allied (2016), a spy film set in World War II directed by Robert Zemeckis, in which she played Marianne Beausejour, a French Resistance fighter.[95][98][99] While critical reviews were mixed, Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine felt that "Pitt and Cotillard give sturdy, coded performances that feel naturalistic, not phony: They understand clearly that their chief mission is to tap the tradition of melodrama, and they take it seriously. Somehow, almost incomprehensibly, it all works. Allied looks old but smells new, and the scent is heady."[100] The film grossed US$120 million worldwide.[101] Cotillard reteamed with Macbeth director Justin Kurzel and co-star Michael Fassbender in the film adaptation of the video game Assassin's Creed (also 2016).[102] On 30 January 2017, Cotillard was honoured with a special award for her career at the 22nd Lumières Awards in France.[103][104] In 2017, she also starred in Guillaume Canet's satire comedy Rock'n Roll, and Arnaud Desplechin's drama Ismael's Ghosts (Les Fantomes d'Ismaël), alongside Mathieu Amalric, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Louis Garrel.[105] The Hollywood Reporter, in its review for the former film, asserted that "Cotillard offers up such a sincere performance that you can't help but laugh".[106] In the 2018 drama Angel Face (Gueule d'ange) by director Vanessa Fialho, she portrayed Marlene, a woman who suddenly chooses to abandon her daughter for a man she has just met during yet another night of excess.

"Home" was produced to remind negotiators and world leaders at the climate talks of our common duty – how to care for the Earth that cares for us all. "This Earth is our shared home, our only home. The time to safeguard its future – and with it our own future – is right now," said Cotillard.[147] In 2008, Cotillard was chosen as the face of Dior's bag "Lady Dior",[148] and was featured in an online short film directed by John Cameron Mitchell about the fictional character created by John Galliano.[149] She starred in a series of short films that were situated in different cities to promote the "Lady Dior" handbags: Lady Noire Affair (in Paris) directed by Olivier Dahan, Lady Blue Shanghai, directed by David Lynch, Lady Rouge (in New York City), directed by Jonas Akerlund, and Lady Grey London, directed by John Cameron Mitchell and starring Ian McKellen and Russell Tovey.[149] This campaign has also resulted in a musical collaboration with Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand, where Cotillard has provided the vocals for a composition performed by the group, entitled "The Eyes of Mars", for the "Lady Rouge" campaign.[150] In 2012, Cotillard starred in the web-series Lady Dior Web Documentary and wrote and performed the song "Lily's body" for one episode, she also designed her own handbag for Dior, the "360° bag".[151] Cotillard also appeared on the cover of the first issue of Dior Magazine in September 2012.[152][153][154] In 2014, she wrote and co-directed alongside Eliott Bliss,[155] a music video for her song "Snapshot in LA", especially for Lady Dior's campaign "Enter The Game – Dior Cuise 2015".[156][157] Cotillard's contract with Dior came to an end in 2017.[158] On 17 February 2020, Cotillard was announced as the new face of the Chanel No. 5 fragrance.[159] Her first commercial for Chanel No. 5 was released on 29 October 2020.[160] It was directed by Johan Renck and featured Cotillard dancing in the moon with French ballet dancer Jérémie Bélingard and singing a cover of Lorde's "Team".[161] In the late 90s, Cotillard was in a relationship with French actor Julien Rassam.[162] She had a long-term relationship with French actor Stéphan Guérin-Tillié from 2000 to 2005.

She ranked No. 18 on British GQ magazine's list of "The World's 20 Coolest Women" in 2014,[192] and was chosen as one of the 'Best Film Femme Fatales' by Harper's Bazaar in 2014, for her performance as Mal in Inception.[193] In April 2016, Vox.com[194] analysed the actresses who have starred in the best reviewed films ranked by average Metacritic rating, and Cotillard was No. 3 with an average score of 68.[195] Cotillard ranked second on Google's "Most Searched Actresses of 2016".[196] In 2017, she was featured on the official poster of the 42nd César Awards.[197] The ivory Jean Paul Gaultier gown Cotillard wore at the 80th Academy Awards on 24 February 2008 is regarded as one of the greatest Oscar dresses of all time.[198][199] In mid-october 2021, a new book Le traître et le néant (English: The traitor and the nether) by two journalists from Le Monde, Gérard Davet and Fabrice Lhomme came out nation-wide in France. Few days later, countless French national newspapers and medias have reported that French President Emmanuel Macron had declared "She pisses me off, Cotillard" (French: Elle me fait chier, Cotillard)[200][201][202] as claimed in this book. Jean-Marc Dumontet is cited as eye-witness.[203] This statement was in response to Cotillard's 2018 criticisms of his policies especially environmental ones, when she stated in Le Parisien : "My faith in politics has been really undermined. He's making promises to have a good image and behind [our backs] does not keeping them at all. I find that unbearable."[204][205][201] Cotillard was mentioned in Trivia, an episode of The Office that aired in January, 2012. Her 2001 film Les Jolies Choses, was the final answer to a trivia contest. Unlikely contestant Kevin Malone (portrayed by Brian Baumgartner) answers correctly and wins the contest. He credits Cotillard's multiple nude scenes in the film for his quick recall.[206] Cotillard has had a look-alike puppet in the French television show Les Guignols de l'info since 2013.[207] In July 2014, a sample of Cotillard and Leonardo DiCaprio's dialogue in the train scene from Inception ("You're waiting for a train..."), was featured on the song "Far Away" by nExow[208] at minute 03:28.[209] Brazilian brand Chara Rial also named a Mocassin shoes after her in 2014.[210] In April 2015, the French rap band Columbine released a song titled "Marion". During the chorus, they sing "Je t'aime, t'es belle comme Marion Cotillard" ("I love you, you're as pretty as Marion Cotillard", in French).[211] In the TV Land sitcom Hot in Cleveland (2014; season 5, episode 12: I Just Met the Man I'm Going to Marry), Wendie Malick's character is presenting the Oscars nominees for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a mise-en-abîme scene and declares "Marion Cotill..., you know the French chick who gets nominated for everything."[212] On April 11, 2015 (Season 40, Episode 18), Cecily Strong debuted her now recurring Saturday Night Live impersonation of Cotillard[213] as a respected and dedicated actress debating the place of women in the film industry[214][215][216] for the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts "Actress Round Table" and "Hollywood Game Night" sketches (other appearances as Cotillard include: Season 42, Episode 1, 8 and 20 as well as Season 43, Episode 3[217]).

She has also won a New York Film Critics Circle Award, a National Society of Film Critics Award, and a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, the critics' awards trifecta. Cotillard and Isabelle Adjani are the only French actresses to win the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Adjani won in 1975 for The Story of Adele H. (1975), while Cotillard was awarded for her performances in The Immigrant (2013) and Two Days, One Night (2014) in 2014. In March 2010, Cotillard was made a Chevalier (Knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of the Arts and Letters) by the French government for her "contribution to the enrichment of French culture".[237] She was promoted to Officier (Officer) on 10 February 2016.[238] On 14 July 2016, Cotillard received France's highest honour – she was named a Chevalier (Knight) of the Légion d'Honneur (Legion of Honor).
