His father, Esteban Molina, was a Spanish immigrant from Murcia, who came to England in 1939, and worked as a waiter and chauffeur.[3] His mother, Giovanna (née Bonelli), was an Italian immigrant who moved to Britain after World War II, and who cleaned rooms in a hotel, and worked as a cook and housekeeper.[4][5] Molina grew up in a working class district in Notting Hill[6] that was inhabited by many other immigrant families.[7] He decided to become an actor after seeing Spartacus at the age of nine, and attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama,[8] as well as auditioning for and becoming a member of the National Youth Theatre.[9] At the age of 21, he changed his name to Alfred, at the urging of his first agent.[10] Molina appeared with Leonard Rossiter in the sitcom The Losers (1978).[11] He made his film debut with a minor role alongside Harrison Ford in Steven Spielberg's adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) as Indiana Jones' ill-fated guide, Satipo, during its iconic opening sequence. Molina stated in an interview in 2013 that he owes his stage and film career to the Indiana Jones series. "I'm very, very proud of that, I have to admit I didn't think at the time, 'Oh, this is going to go down in movie history.' I'd never been in front of a camera before", Molina said about his short but memorable appearance in Raiders of the Lost Ark. He recalled getting the job as a "gift from God" and said "I've publicly thanked Steven many, many times. That job saved my bacon, in more ways than one." About his now-famous line in the film, Molina stated that "I've never had a problem with people coming up to me about it. They'll shout that line to me, 'Throw me the idol, I'll throw you the whip!' I'm delighted that people still remember it."[12] However, his big break came with Letter to Brezhnev (1985), which he followed with a starring role in Prick Up Your Ears (1987), playing Joe Orton's lover (and eventual murderer) Kenneth Halliwell.
