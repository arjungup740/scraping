I don't remember a mass shooting in Australia since they overhauled the gun laws. It seems like every week in America there's a shooting. I just want people to be safe, especially people that are doing one of my favorite things in the world—going out to the movies to have fun."[83][84][85] In 2014, Wilson paid $3.75 million for her Sydney harbourside home. The 1900s freestanding Victorian house underwent $900,000 of renovations. Wilson also settled on a Balmain investment apartment, a conversion of a historic mansion. The New York-inspired terrace home took three years to complete. Wilson paid $1.88 million off the plan in 2015 for the two-bedroom apartment.[86][87] Wilson is a fan of the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL.[88] As her 40th birthday approached, Wilson made the decision to freeze her eggs which spurred on her effort to make healthy life changes. Wilson has polycystic ovarian syndrome and suffers from emotional eating due to pressures of fame.[89] A fierce advocate for body positivity, Wilson has been a role model for larger women. "There's a lot of pressure on women, especially younger women, to conform to the thin body image", she told the Associated Press. "Not everyone can be that way and no one should be ashamed of how they look or suffer bullying and other forms of abuse because of their size and shape."[67] Throughout her career, Wilson has been known for her plus-sized figure and would often play to it in her acting work with characters such as "Fat Amy". In a 2013 interview with Hunger Magazine, Wilson stated "As long as I look like this, I'm going to make fat jokes. All comedians have to use their physicality, so I use my size."[90] Wilson said that her agency signed her almost on the spot because they had nobody on their books like her.[91] Wilson felt lucky to have her body type and stated that people in the industry would tell her not to lose weight. "For me, I think it's about being comfortable in your own skin. I never want to be too unhealthy, because that's bad. You just want to be comfortable with who you are at whatever size", she said.[91] In 2016 Wilson said that she felt bigger girls did better in comedy because they are easier to laugh at and used that to her advantage.[92] In July 2011, Wilson became a spokesperson for weight loss and nutrition company Jenny Craig in Australia.[93][94] In January 2012, Wilson told The Daily Telegraph that she had lost 10 kilograms (22 lb) since signing up to the program.[95] In February 2013, she confirmed that she had ended her agreement with Jenny Craig the previous year.[96] Wilson asserted that the producers of Pitch Perfect had refused to let her lose any more weight during filming, as her contract stated she must stay the same size. She said that once her film commitments were over, she would start her diet again to reach her target weight of 80 kilograms (180 lb).[95] In her 2020 "year of health", Wilson made it her mission to lose 60 pounds and did so by November 2020. Wilson stated that she has always been confident in how she looked, but now feels "super confident".[97] In May 2015, Australian magazine Woman's Day published a story claiming that Wilson had been misleading about her birth name, age, and upbringing.[98] Wilson had previously said in interviews that she was raised by dog-training "bogan" parents in the ghetto of Sydney, spent a year in Zimbabwe, climbed into a cage with a leopard, got caught in a shoot-out and then struck down by a severe strain of malaria from a mosquito in Mozambique where, from her intensive care bed, she envisioned herself winning an Oscar and rapping her acceptance speech.[99] Her age was also incorrectly given as 29 (when it was actually 35), which she would later admit was something she chose not to correct.[17] Woman's Day called all of this into question and claimed that Wilson had, on the contrary, a "very normal, upper-middle-class upbringing" and "added a touch of 'fantasy' to the life she led before becoming a household name."[98] The story was picked up by several other publications including The Sydney Morning Herald, People magazine,[100] the Chicago Tribune[101] and The Huffington Post.[102] Most notably, Wilson's true birth date was confirmed through business records filed with the ASIC, which were obtained by The Sydney Morning Herald.[103] On 16 May 2016, Wilson said print and online articles in Woman's Day, the Australian Women's Weekly, NW and OK! magazines made her out to be a serial liar. According to a defamation writ filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Wilson said her reputation and credit had suffered and she had been humiliated and embarrassed. She also sued for special damages, claiming she missed out on roles and other ones were terminated because of the articles.[104] Wilson was represented by Matthew Collins QC. On 15 June 2017, a six-person jury ruled in Wilson's favour, finding that publisher Bauer Media Group had indeed wrongly painted the actress as a serial liar, and that publishing the articles was likely to have caused harm to her career.[105] On 13 September 2017, Wilson was awarded A$4,500,000 in damages. Wilson's lawyer Richard Leder, said "Today's verdict is a significant record—it's about four times the highest previous verdict in a defamation case in Australia." In June 2017, Wilson tweeted "Any dollars I receive will go to charity, scholarships or invested into the Aussie film industry to provide jobs."[106][107] Bauer Media appealed the amount of the damages.[108] On 14 June 2018, Bauer Media won its appeal and the damages were reduced to $600,000, meaning that she had to pay back A$4.1m and A$60,000 in interest. She also had to cover 80% of what Bauer spent on its appeal.[109][110] Wilson announced her intention to appeal the decision,[111] and lodged an appeal with the High Court on 11 July 2018.[112] The High Court refused the application on 16 November 2018.[113][114]
