Janet Maslin, in her New York Times review, states, "Woods's performance as the hateful old reprobate Beckwith is the film's chief sign of life".[30] The Los Angeles Times published an article titled "James Woods is So Good at Being Bad". In the articles it describes Woods having aggressively lobbied director Rob Reiner for the role, which Reiner originally intended for an actor in his 70s, like Paul Newman.[19]
"Beckwith's Mississippi accent, which Woods perfected by watching tapes and working with an accent coach, helped him distance himself from the character. 'I imagined I was speaking a foreign language'."[19] Woods earned a Golden Globe nomination as well as his second Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[citation needed] Woods would later voice Hades in the Disney Animated film, Hercules (1997), where he received critical praise.[31] Critic Roger Ebert described Woods' performance as full of "diabolical glee" and compared his performance of "verbal inventiveness" to that of Robin Williams in Aladdin.[32] Janet Maslin of The New York Times also praised Woods' performance remarking "Woods shows off the full verve of an edgy Scarfe villain".[33]

However, in an unexpected later ruling, the user's Anti-SLAPP motion was denied and Woods was permitted to pursue his lawsuit against List, with the ten other defendants being dropped from the lawsuit.[64][65] In October 2016, the appeal by the defendant was dismissed; attorney Lisa Bloom, who represented the anonymous Twitter user, revealed that the user had suddenly died.[66] The case was settled out of court soon afterwards, with Woods getting a letter from Bloom saying that her client "regretted making the tweet and further regrets any harm caused to Mr. Woods' reputation by the tweet."[67] In 2017, shortly before the Abe List litigation was resolved, Portia Boulger sued Woods for misidentifying her as a Nazi in an allegedly libelous tweet.[68] The tweet included a photo of a different woman giving a Nazi salute while wearing a Donald Trump t-shirt at a campaign event and misidentified the woman as Boulger.[69] Boulger sought $3 million in the lawsuit.[69] The court ruled in favor of Woods under the innocent construction rule.
