 Alan Wolf Arkin (born March 26, 1934) is an American actor, director and screenwriter. Throughout his career spanning over six decades, he has received various accolades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and a Golden Globe Award. Arkin is known for his performances in The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming (1966), Wait Until Dark (1967), The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1968), Catch-22 (1970); The In-Laws (1979), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), Grosse Point Blank (1997), Thirteen Conversations About One Thing (2001), Little Miss Sunshine (2006) and Argo (2012). For his performance in Little Miss Sunshine, he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.[1] Arkin was born in Brooklyn New York, on March 26, 1934, the son of David I. Arkin, a painter and writer and his wife, Beatrice (née Wortis), a teacher.[2] He was raised in a Jewish family with "no emphasis on religion".[3] His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Ukraine, Russia, and Germany.[4][5][6][7] His parents moved to Los Angeles when Alan was 11,[4] but an 8-month Hollywood strike cost his father his job as a set designer. During the 1950s Red Scare, Arkin's parents were accused of being Communists, and his father was fired when he refused to answer questions about his political ideology. David Arkin challenged the dismissal, but he was vindicated only after his death.[8] Arkin, who had been taking acting lessons since age 10, became a scholarship student at various drama academies, including one run by the Stanislavsky student Benjamin Zemach, who taught Arkin a psychological approach to acting.[9] Arkin attended Los Angeles State College from 1951 to 1953. He also attended Bennington College.[10] Arkin was an early member of the Second City comedy troupe in the 1960s.[11] Arkin is one of only six[12] actors to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his first screen appearance (for The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming in 1966).[13] Two years later, he was nominated for The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.[14][15] In 1968, he appeared in the title role of Inspector Clouseau after Peter Sellers dissociated himself from the role, but the film was not well received by Sellers' fans. Arkin and his second wife Barbara Dana appeared together on the 1970–1971 season of Sesame Street as a comical couple named Larry and Phyllis who resolve their conflicts when they remember how to pronounce the word "cooperate." Arkin and Dana later appeared in 1987 on the sitcom Harry, which was canceled after four low-rated episodes. His best known films include Wait Until Dark as the erudite killer stalking Audrey Hepburn; The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming as the leader of the landing party from the stranded Soviet submarine, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, Catch-22, as Yossarian, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, Little Murders, The In-Laws, Glengarry Glen Ross, and Little Miss Sunshine, for which he won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar; and Argo. His portrayal of Dr. Oatman, a psychiatrist treating John Cusack's hit man character in Grosse Point Blank, was also well received. His role in Little Miss Sunshine as a foul-mouthed grandfather with a taste for snorting heroin won him the BAFTA Film Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. On receiving his Academy Award on February 25, 2007, Arkin said "More than anything, I'm deeply moved by the open-hearted appreciation our small film has received, which in these fragmented times speaks so openly of the possibility of innocence, growth, and connection".[16] At 72 years old, Arkin was the sixth oldest winner of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.[17] In 2006–2007, Arkin was cast in supporting roles in Rendition as a U.S. Senator and The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause as Bud Newman (Carol's Father). On Broadway, Arkin starred in Enter Laughing (for which he won a Tony Award) and Luv. He also directed The Sunshine Boys. In 1969, Arkin's directorial debut was the Oscar-nominated[18][19] 12-minute children's film titled People Soup, starring his sons Adam Arkin and Matthew Arkin.[20][21] Based on a story of the same name he published in Galaxy Science Fiction in 1958,[22] People Soup is a fantasy about two boys who experiment with various kitchen ingredients until they concoct a magical soup which transforms them into different animals and objects. His most acclaimed directorial effort is Little Murders, released in 1971. Written by cartoonist Jules Feiffer, it is a black comedy film starring Elliott Gould and Marcia Rodd about a girl, Patsy (Rodd), who brings home her boyfriend Alfred (Gould) to meet her dysfunctional family amid a series of random shootings, garbage strikes, and electrical outages ravaging the neighborhood. The film opened to a lukewarm review by Roger Greenspan,[23] and a more positive one by Vincent Canby[24] in The New York Times. Roger Ebert's review in the Chicago Sun-Times was enthusiastic, stating "One of the reasons it works and is indeed a definitive reflection of America's darker moods is that it breaks audiences down into isolated individuals, vulnerable and uncertain."[25] Arkin also directed Fire Sale (1977), Samuel Beckett Is Coming Soon (1993), and Arigo (2000). Arkin is the author of many books, including Tony's Hard Work Day (illustrated by James Stevenson, 1972), The Lemming Condition (illustrated by Joan Sandin, 1976), Halfway Through the Door: An Actor's Journey Toward Self (1979), and The Clearing (1986 continuation of Lemming). He has released two memoirs: An Improvised Life (2011) and Out of My Mind (2018).[26][27] With two friends, he formed the folk group The Tarriers, in which Arkin sang and played guitar. The band members co-composed the group's 1956 hit "The Banana Boat Song", a reworking, with some new lyrics, of a traditional, Jamaican calypso folk song of the same name, combined with another titled "Hill and Gully Rider".[28] It reached No. 4 on the Billboard magazine chart the same year as Harry Belafonte's better-known hit version.[29] The group appeared in the 1957 Calypso-exploitation film Calypso Heat Wave, singing "Banana Boat Song" and "Choucoune".[30][31] Arkin was a member of The Tarriers when they recorded "Cindy, Oh Cindy" which went to the top of the charts. From 1958 to 1968, Arkin performed and recorded with the children's folk group The Baby Sitters.[32] He also performed the role of Dr. Pangloss in a concert staging of Leonard Bernstein's operetta Candide, alongside Madeline Kahn's Cunegonde. In 1985, he sang two selections by Jones and Schmidt on Ben Bagley's album Contemporary Broadway Revisited. In 2014, Arkin received the Gregory Peck Award for Cinematic Excellence to honor his life's work at the San Diego Film Festival.[33] Arkin has been married three times, with two ending in divorce. He and Jeremy Yaffe (m. 1955–1961) have two sons: Adam Arkin, born August 19, 1956, and Matthew Arkin, born March 21, 1960. He was married to actress-screenwriter Barbara Dana from 1964 to 1994: she appeared with him in segments of the TV show Sesame Street in the 1970s. They lived in Chappaqua, New York. In 1967, they had a son, Anthony (Tony) Dana Arkin.[34] In 1996, Arkin married psychotherapist Suzanne Newlander,[8] whose surname he adopted for his character Norman Newlander in The Kominsky Method. They live in Carlsbad, California.
