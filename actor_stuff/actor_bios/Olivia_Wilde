The Los Angeles Times wrote that it "leaves you feeling unaccountably hopeful for the state of humanity – and the state of American screen comedy too", and The Wall Street Journal noted, "Nothing funnier, smarter, quicker or more joyous has graced the big screen in a long time."[43] The film won the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature at the 35th Independent Spirit Awards on February 8, 2020.[44] Wilde next appeared in Richard Jewell in 2019, playing Atlanta-Journal Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs who died in 2001.[45] The film was criticised for depicting Scruggs as offering to trade sex with an FBI agent in return for confidential information.[46] The editor-in-chief of The Atlanta-Journal Constitution wrote in an open letter that this depicted incident was "entirely false and malicious".[47] Employees of the newspaper demanded the film have a prominent disclaimer that "some events were imagined for dramatic purposes and artistic license."[48][49] The film was accused of perpetuating a sexist trope of women journalists exchanging sex for information.[50][51] Wilde defended her role and stated that there was a sexist double standard, in that Jon Hamm's FBI agent character was not held to the same scrutiny.[52] Commentators noted that Wilde's character was based on a real person, whereas the FBI agent was an amalgamation of multiple characters from the original script.[52] They also stated that the purpose of the film was to expose and condemn the character assassination of Jewell; however, in the process, the film commits the same character assassination of Scruggs.[50] She also directed Wake Up, a short film starring Margaret Qualley.[53] Wilde will direct and play a supporting role in Don't Worry Darling, a erotic psychological thriller about a 1950s housewife,[54] starring Florence Pugh, Harry Styles, Kiki Layne and Chris Pine, for New Line Cinema from a screenplay by Katie Silberman.[55][56] She is also attached to direct Perfect, a biopic about gymnast Kerri Strug for Searchlight Pictures,[57] an untitled holiday-comedy film for Universal Pictures,[58] and a female-centered superhero film as part of the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters franchise.[59] In 2008, Wilde campaigned with actors Justin Long and her then-current House castmate Kal Penn in support for the Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama.[60] Wilde was a supporter of the youth voter organization, 18 in '08.
