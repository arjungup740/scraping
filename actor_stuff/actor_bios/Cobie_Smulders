She was named after her great-aunt, from whom she gained the nickname "Cobie".[4] Smulders describes herself as "a fluent listener" of French.[5] She has four sisters.[6] Smulders was also a member of the Girl Guides of Canada as a child, participating as a Brownie (Girl Guide program for 7- to 10-year-olds).[7] Smulders worked in modelling, which she later said she "kind of hated", adding that the experience made her hesitant about pursuing acting as a career: "You know, you go into these rooms, and I've had the experience of people judging you physically for so long and I was over that. But then it was like, 'Oh no, I have to actually perform. I have to do well, and I have to have a voice, and I have to have thoughts now.'"[8] In her youth, Smulders aspired to be a marine biologist.[5] She took an interest in theatre throughout high school and briefly studied at the University of Victoria before returning to acting.[5] Smulders' first acting role was as a guest in the Showtime science-fiction series Jeremiah; she subsequently made multiple appearances on television, including a recurring role on The L Word. Her first role as a series regular was in the short-lived ABC series Veritas: The Quest, which ran for one season. After the cancellation of Veritas, Smulders was cast as television reporter Robin Scherbatsky on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother in 2005. The show continued for nine seasons, winning 10 Emmy Awards.[9] In June 2010, Smulders made her off-Broadway debut in Love, Loss, and What I Wore at the Westside Theatre.[10] Smulders played Maria Hill in the 2012 film The Avengers.

She had surgery to remove two tumors from her ovaries, but the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes, resulting in the need for multiple operations over the course of two years.[27][28] In August 2019, Smulders revealed she is in remission.[29] In 2020, Smulders announced that she became an American citizen, while still retaining her Canadian citizenship.[3] Smulders filmed a public service announcement with Oceana, an international ocean-conservation organization, in 2014.[30][31] In May 2020, she released a clip parodying "Let's Go to the Mall", a song her character performed on How I Met Your Mother, titled "Let's All Stay at Home", to encourage the public to enforce COVID-19 lockdowns. Smulders also encouraged fans to donate to Save the Children, Canada Helps and the Daily Bread Food Bank amidst the pandemic.[32] In September 2020, she promoted cleaning up refuse and litter with National CleanUp Day, Clean Trails and Planet Oat.
