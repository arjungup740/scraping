Born and raised in New York City, Stiles started acting at the age of 11 performing with New York's La Mama Experimental Theater Club.[1] Her first film role was in I Love You, I Love You Not (1996), followed by a leading role in the thriller Wicked (1998) for which she was awarded the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival Award for Best Actress. She gained prominence for her lead roles in teen films such as 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), for which she won the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance and was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards; Down to You (2000) for which she was nominated for another two Teen Choice Awards; and Save the Last Dance (2001), winning the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress and receiving a nomination for the MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance. Stiles moved on to more adult roles, including The Business of Strangers (2001), for which she garnered a nomination for the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture; Mona Lisa Smile (2003); and The Omen (2006). She became known to a wider audience for her supporting role alongside Matt Damon as Nicky Parsons in the Bourne film series (2002–2016). She had a recurring role as Lumen Pierce in the fifth season of the Showtime series Dexter (2010), a role that earned her nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. As a member of the cast of Silver Linings Playbook (2012), Stiles was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. Stiles stars in the Sky Atlantic series Riviera (2017–present), and appears in the Blue web series also broadcast on television (2012–2015). Other film roles include romantic comedy The Prince and Me (2004), noir-inspired drama-thriller A Little Trip to Heaven (2005), British-Canadian co-production The Cry of the Owl (2009), Between Us (2012), Out of the Dark (2014), and with Anthony Hopkins in Blackway (2016) also known as Go with Me.[2] Stiles was born in New York City[3] to parents Judith Newcomb Stiles, a Greenwich Village artist, and John O'Hara, an elementary school teacher. She is the oldest of three children; her siblings are John Junior and Jane (a fellow actress).[4] Stiles is of English, Irish, and Italian descent.[5] She started acting at the age of 11 performing with New York's La MaMa Theatre Company.[6] Stiles's first film role was in I Love You, I Love You Not (1996), with Claire Danes and Jude Law.[7] She also had small roles as Harrison Ford's character's daughter in Alan J. Pakula's The Devil's Own (1997) and in M. Night Shyamalan's Wide Awake (1998). Her first lead was in Wicked (1998) playing a teenage girl who might have murdered her mother so she could have her father all to herself. Critic Joe Balthai wrote she was "the darling of the 1998 Sundance Film Festival."[8] She next starred in a made-for-TV movie titled The '60s in 1999. Later that year, she portrayed Kat Stratford, opposite Heath Ledger in Gil Junger's 10 Things I Hate About You, an adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew set in a high school in Tacoma, Washington. She won an MTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Female Performance for the role. The Chicago Film Critics voted her the most promising new actress of the year. Her next starring role was in Down to You (2000) which was panned by critics, but earned both her and her co-star Freddie Prinze, Jr. a Teen Choice Award nomination for their on-screen chemistry. She subsequently appeared in two more Shakespearean adaptations. The first was as Ophelia in Michael Almereyda's Hamlet (2000), with Ethan Hawke in the lead. The second was in the Desdemona role, opposite Mekhi Phifer, in Tim Blake Nelson's O (2001), a version of Othello set at a boarding school. Neither film was a great success; O was subject to many delays and a change of distributors, and Hamlet was an art house film shot on a minimal budget. Stiles next commercial success was in Save the Last Dance (2001) as an aspiring ballerina forced to leave her small town in downstate Illinois to live with her struggling musician father in Chicago after her mother dies in a car accident. At her new, nearly all-black school, she falls in love with the character played by Sean Patrick Thomas who teaches her hip-hop dance steps which help get her into the Juilliard School. The role won her two more MTV awards for Best Kiss and Best Female Performance and a Teen Choice Award for best fight scene for her battle with Bianca Lawson. Rolling Stone named her "the coolest co-ed" and put her on the cover of its April 12, 2001, issue.[9] She told Rolling Stone that she performed all her own dancing in the film, though the way the film was shot and edited might have made it appear otherwise.[9] In David Mamet's State and Main (2000), about a film shooting on location in a small town in Vermont, she played a teenaged girl who seduces a film actor (Alec Baldwin) with a weakness for teen girls. Stiles also appeared opposite Stockard Channing in the dark art house film The Business of Strangers (2001) as a conniving, amoral secretary who exacts revenge on her boss. Channing was impressed by her co-star: "In addition to her talent, she has a quality that is almost feral, something that can make people uneasy. She has an effect on people."[10] Stiles also had a small role as Treadstone operative Nicolette "Nicky" Parsons in The Bourne Identity (2002), a role that was enlarged in The Bourne Supremacy (2004), then greatly expanded in The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). Between the Bourne films, she appeared in Mona Lisa Smile (2003) as Joan, a student at Wellesley College in 1953, whose art professor (Julia Roberts) encourages her to pursue a career in law rather than become a wife and mother. Critic Stephen Holden referred to her as one of cinema's "brightest young stars",[11] but the film met with generally unfavorable reviews. Stiles played a Wisconsin college student who is swept off her feet by a Danish prince, played by Luke Mably in The Prince and Me (2004) which was directed by Martha Coolidge. Stiles told an interviewer that she was very similar to her character Paige Morgan. Critic Scott Foundas said she was, as always "irrepressibly engaging" and the film was a "strange career choice for Stiles".[12] This echoed criticism in reviews of A Guy Thing (2003), a romantic comedy with Jason Lee and Selma Blair. Critic Dennis Harvey wrote that Stiles was "wasted"[13] and Stephen Holden called her "a serious actress from whom comedy does not seem to flow naturally".[14] In 2005, Stiles was cast opposite her Hamlet co-star Liev Schreiber in The Omen, a remake of the 1976 horror film. The film was released on June 6, 2006.[15] She returned to the Bourne series with a much larger role in The Bourne Ultimatum in 2007 which is her highest-grossing film to date. Stiles began filming Between Us in May 2011 with co-stars Taye Diggs, David Harbour, and Melissa George. Between Us is the screen adaptation of the off-Broadway play by the same name written by playwright Joe Hortua.[16] In 2012, Stiles starred alongside David Cross and America Ferrera in the dark comedy It's a Disaster.[17] The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival and was picked up by Oscilloscope Laboratories and received a commercial release in April 2013.
Stiles had a small but pivotal role as a reporter in the 2013 British-American film Closed Circuit. In April 2013, it was announced that Stiles would be starring in an indie supernatural thriller Out of the Dark alongside Scott Speedman and Stephen Rea.

Bush's daughter Jenna Bush in a skit that poked fun at the two first daughters for being arrested for underaged drinking. MTV profiled her in its Diary series in 2003,[31] and she was Punk'd by Ashton Kutcher at a Washington, D.C., museum in the spring of 2004.[32] Stiles made her writing and directorial debut with Elle magazine's short Raving starring Zooey Deschanel.[33] It premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.[34] In May 2010, Stiles was cast in a major role in the Showtime series Dexter[35][36][37] and signed for 10 episodes.[38] For this role, Stiles received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film,[39] as well as a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.

She works at an office and also as a call girl to make ends meet on an otherwise meager income fighting to protect her son from the collision between her complicated past and tenuous present.[40] For her work on Blue, Stiles won two IAWTV Awards, in 2013 and 2014.[41] The actress during the recordings shared set with artists like  Michelle Forbes, JC Gonzalez, and Uriah Shelton.
