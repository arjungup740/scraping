The character was not originally in the comic book series of the same name, but was created specifically for Reedus after his audition for the character of Merle Dixon. The Walking Dead comic creator Robert Kirkman feels "absolutely blessed Reedus has honored the show with his presence, and the way he has come in and taken over that role and defined Daryl Dixon. A lot of Reedus's portrayal of the character in the first season inspired all the writers to do what we did with him in the second season. We love writing him and end up doing cool stuff with him." The drama has evolved into the highest-rated in cable history, smashing all previous records.[16] Reedus was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Reedus is also set to reprise his role of Daryl as the lead of a spin-off series centered on his character and Carol Peletier (played by Melissa McBride), following the conclusion of the 11th and final season of The Walking Dead.
