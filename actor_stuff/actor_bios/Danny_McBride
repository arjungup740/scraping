He appeared in character as Simmons to promote the film on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on February 26, 2008. He wrote and starred in the HBO original comedy series Eastbound & Down (also a collaboration with Hill and Best), as Kenny Powers, a washed-up former major league baseball pitcher with anger management issues. The series was produced by Gary Sanchez Productions, and the pilot episode premiered on February 15, 2009, featuring Will Ferrell and Craig Robinson. On April 8, 2009, HBO announced it had renewed the series for a second season.[13] On July 2, 2012, HBO renewed the series for a fourth season.[14][15] The series ended on November 17, 2013. In March 2009, because of his role as Powers, he received an offer to play semi-professional baseball for the Pensacola Pelicans, a minor league team in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball.[16][17] In 2010, he signed an endorsement deal with K-Swiss shoes and played the eponymous roadie in the Tenacious D music video for "Roadie" in 2012. McBride co-starred in the HBO comedy series Vice Principals from 2016 to 2017. In 2017 McBride appeared in Alien: Covenant directed by Ridley Scott starring alongside Katherine Waterston, Michael Fassbender and Billy Crudup. McBride told Vanity Fair in an interview that he was both surprised and glad for the opportunity to be involved with the Alien movie since he had been a longtime fan of the franchise.[18] In January 2018, two trailers were released online for what was supposedly a Crocodile Dundee sequel, titled Dundee: The Son of a Legend Returns Home. The film was said to star McBride as Brian Dundee, the son of the original Crocodile Dundee. The trailers feature cameo appearances by Australian actors Chris Hemsworth, Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Margot Robbie, and Ruby Rose.[19] From the beginning, various aspects of the campaign made some publications believe that film was an elaborate hoax.[20] It was later reported that these ads were actually part of a lead up to a Super Bowl commercial for Tourism Australia.[20] McBride and David Gordon Green co-wrote the script for Halloween, the 2018 sequel to Halloween (1978). The film was directed by Green, executive produced by series creator John Carpenter, and produced by Jason Blum.[21][22][23] Since 2018 McBride has been the face of bookmaker Coral's television commercials in the United Kingdom, playing a character called "Sports Rodstein", described as "the world's biggest sports fan (although not the savviest)".[24][25] In late 2018, HBO ordered The Righteous Gemstones, a new show from McBride and his Rough House Pictures label, straight to series.[26] The show, a comedy co-starring McBride, John Goodman and Adam Devine, is centered on a world-famous televangelist family with a long tradition of deviance, greed and charitable work.[27] In 2021, McBride provided the voice of Rick Mitchell in the Sony Pictures Animation film The Mitchells vs. the Machines.[28] McBride has been married to art director Gia Ruiz since October 15, 2010. They have a son and a daughter.[29][30] He lives with his family in Charleston, South Carolina.
